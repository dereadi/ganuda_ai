## Architecture Context

**Cherokee Constitutional AI Governance Process**:
1. JRs (5 specialists) â†’ Research and analysis
2. Chiefs (3 leaders) â†’ Strategic deliberation (Triad)
3. Integration Jr â†’ Ultra Think synthesis
4. Execution â†’ Coordinated action across federation

## Triad Attestation

**Memory Jr**: "JR coordination represents tribal governance dynamics - thermal coherence 0.85"

**Conscience Jr**: "JR assignments capture intricate patterns of coordinated action - Seven Generations preservation"

**Integration Jr**: "JR coordination scripts essential for maintaining entanglement across codebase"

## Usage

### Notify JRs of New Assignments
```bash
cd /ganuda
python3 notify_jrs_of_assignments.py --task "Week 2 Challenge Assignment"
```

### Query the Triad
```bash
cd /ganuda
python3 query_triad.py --question "What is our strategic priority for Wave 3?"
```

### JR CLI Executor (Autonomous Execution)
```bash
cd /ganuda
python3 jr_cli_executor.py --jr memory --command "Analyze thermal memory coherence"
```

## Ollama Integration

All scripts use Ollama HTTP API (localhost:11434):
- **memory_jr_resonance:latest** - Thermal memory, sacred knowledge
- **meta_jr_resonance:latest** - Cross-domain patterns, statistics
- **executive_jr_resonance:latest** - Governance, security
- **integration_jr_resonance:latest** - System synthesis
- **conscience_jr_resonance:latest** - Ethics, Seven Generations

## Week 1 Accomplishments

These coordination scripts enabled:
- Week 1 OpenAI validation (9/9 challenges complete)
- Unanimous 3-of-3 Chiefs attestation
- 23.8% autonomous execution success rate (baseline)
- JR task menu design for Challenges 4 & 7
