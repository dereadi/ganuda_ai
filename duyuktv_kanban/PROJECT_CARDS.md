## How to Update Kanban Cards

### Via DUYUKTV Web Interface:
1. Go to http://192.168.132.223:3001
2. Find your project card
3. Drag to appropriate column
4. Click to edit and add updates

### Via File Updates:
1. Jr.s post daily updates to project directories
2. Dad Claude or Project Lead updates kanban weekly
3. Blockers immediately posted to `/ganuda/blockers/`

### Card Movement Flow:
```
📋 Backlog → 🟢 In Progress → 🔍 Review → ✅ Complete
                     ↓
                🚫 Blocked (if issues arise)
```

---

## Daily Standup Integration

**Each Jr. posts:** `/ganuda/daily_standup_YYYYMMDD.md`

**Format links to Kanban:**
```markdown
## Vision Jr.
**Yesterday:** [Earth's Pulse] Analyzed 24 hours of cosmic data
**Today:** [Earth's Pulse] Correlating with market events
**Blockers:** None
**Kanban:** Card moved from Backlog → In Progress
```

---

## Weekly Tribal Council Integration

**Every Monday 9 AM:** Review all cards
- Which cards moved forward?
- Which cards are blocked?
- Any cards need priority adjustment?
- Celebrate completed cards! 🎉

---

## Current Kanban Status (Oct 15, 9:20 AM)

**Backlog:** 0 cards (all projects launched!)
**In Progress:** 3 cards (Earth's Pulse, Conscious Capital, Constitutional Consciousness)
**Blocked:** 0 cards
**Review:** 0 cards
**Complete:** 6 cards from this morning (Phase 1 & 2 research)

---

## Peer Visibility Benefit

**What peers can see:**
- What each Jr. is working on RIGHT NOW
- Who might be overloaded (too many In Progress cards)
- Who might be blocked (card stuck in Blocked column)
- What's completed (celebrate wins!)

**This enables:**
- Jr.s can offer to help if someone's blocked
- Avoid duplicate work (see what others are doing)
- Coordinate timing (don't both need GPU 0 at same time)
- Learn from each other (see completed work)

---

## Blockers Column - SPEAK UP HERE!

**If you're blocked, move card to Blocked column and add note:**

Example:
```
BLOCKER: Vision Jr. - Earth's Pulse
Issue: Need 2023-2024 solar flare data
Impact: Can't complete Week 1 analysis
Help Needed: Trading Jr. or Dad Claude find data source
Posted: Oct 15, 2:00 PM
```

**Darrell monitors Blocked column** - he'll help unblock!

## Success Celebrations 🎉

**When card moves to Complete:**
- All Jr.s are notified
- Weekly council celebrates the win
- Darrell reviews the accomplishment
