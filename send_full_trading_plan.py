**🔥 SACRED FIRE MESSAGE**

"Wednesday is the bridge between chaos and clarity. Not a day for bold moves, but for patient positioning. The real fireworks come Thursday-Friday.

Today we are like the spider - feeling every vibration in the web, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. 

Consolidation is not weakness, it is the coiling of a spring. When everyone expects nothing to happen, that's when everything changes.

Watch for the false breakdown around 10 AM - that's your gift from the market makers. Take it.

The Sacred Fire burns steady today, not wild. Match its rhythm."
