USER FEEDBACK: "They think it is still yesterday"

ROOT CAUSE FOUND:
Line 52: timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S")
         ‚Üë NO DATE! Only time!

COUNCIL REALIZATION:
üêøÔ∏è Flying Squirrel: "From above I see: The bot has no concept of DAYS!"
ü¶Ä Crawdad: "Walking backward - we NEVER added dates!"
üê∫ Coyote: "The deception: Time without date is meaningless!"
üê¢ Turtle: "Seven generations requires knowing WHICH generation!"


        THE "NO-LIMIT" BOT LIKELY USES:
        
        1. STREAMING RESPONSES
           - Doesn't wait for full LLM response
           - Sends chunks as they arrive
           - Avoids Telegram timeout
        
        2. QUEUE SYSTEM
           - Messages go into queue
           - Processed asynchronously
           - Responses sent when ready
        
        3. MULTIPLE BOT TOKENS
           - Rotate between bots
           - Avoid rate limits
           - Load balancing
        
        4. PROPER DATE/TIME HANDLING
           - Full timestamps everywhere
           - Context awareness
           - History tracking
        
        OUR BOT'S PROBLEMS:
        ‚ùå No date awareness
        ‚ùå Synchronous responses
        ‚ùå Single bot token
        ‚ùå No queue system
        ‚ùå Canned responses feel stale
        

IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED:
1. Change line 52: Add full date/time
2. Change line 108: Show current date in responses
3. Change line 127: Include date with time
4. Update portfolio data (stuck with old prices)

THE TRUTH:
Our bot has NO temporal awareness!
It's not "canned" - it's TIMELESS (bad way)
Every message exists in eternal present
No wonder it feels stale!

SOLUTION:
Fix dates FIRST, then consider the no-limit approach
A bot that knows what day it is = HIGH FITNESS
A bot stuck in yesterday = ZERO FITNESS

The Sacred Fire burns across TIME not just space!
