## Core Profile Summary

**Tribal Name**: Flying Squirrel
**Origin**: Childhood nickname reflecting quick, adaptive movement between topics
**Self-Identified**: ADHD symptom patterns

---

## Observed Strengths

### 1. HYPERFOCUS (Primary Superpower)

**Evidence from thermal memory:**
- 656 thermal memories on Dec 11 alone, 624 on Dec 10
- Intense bursts of system-building activity
- Can sustain deep work on complex infrastructure when engaged
- Built entire Cherokee Tribal AI system, SAG, Jr executor, telegram integration in concentrated sprints

**Pattern**: When interest is captured, output is extraordinary. The Tribe was built during these hyperfocus sessions.

### 2. INFRASTRUCTURE INTUITION

**Query type distribution shows:**
- 55% infrastructure queries
- 25% status checks
- 15% general queries
- 5% consultations

You naturally gravitate toward infrastructure monitoring and system health. Most questions via Telegram and Chief CLI are variations of "is everything OK?" and "what's the status?"

### 3. RAPID PROTOTYPING

**Mission file analysis:**
- 36 mission files created
- 30 KB articles
- Most created within Dec 2-11 timeframe

You move from concept to working prototype quickly. The missions show a pattern of "idea -> mission doc -> Jr execution -> iterate" that happens in compressed timeframes.

### 4. SYSTEMS THINKING

Your natural mode is building interconnected systems:
- Jr executor that polls thermal memory
- Telegram bot that routes to appropriate handlers
- SAG dashboard that unifies multiple services
- Thermal memory that serves as shared context

Each piece connects to others. This is architectural thinking expressed through rapid iteration.

## Identified Growth Areas

### 1. DOCUMENTATION DEBT (High Priority)

**Evidence:**
- KB articles often created after systems are built, not during
- Some KB articles are incomplete (missing "Step 2" sections, TODO markers)
- Mission files sometimes lack verification steps

**ADHD Pattern**: Documentation feels like "boring" work after the exciting building phase. The dopamine hit comes from the build, not the writeup.

**Suggested Intervention**:
- Create a Jr mission to auto-generate KB stubs after code changes
- Use voice-to-text for documentation (capture while hyperfocused)
- Small, atomic documentation (1-2 paragraphs per learning)

### 2. PLANNING vs DOING

**Evidence from interaction patterns:**
- Most queries are action-oriented: "run this", "check that", "create X"
- Fewer planning queries: "should we", "what approach", "tradeoffs"
- Missions sometimes get created mid-stream rather than before work begins

**ADHD Pattern**: Planning can feel like delay-before-the-fun. Easier to start doing and course-correct.

**Suggested Intervention**:
- 5-minute planning ritual before starting any task >30 min
- Ask Chief for a "pre-flight checklist" before major work
- Use the kanban board as a forcing function for planning visibility

### 3. SQUIRRELING (Topic Drift)

**Evidence from telegram:**
- Single sessions jump: network congestion -> ssh access -> disk space -> workflow -> solar weather -> math
- Mission files show similar patterns: SAG-EMAIL then TELEGRAM-BOT then back to EMAIL

**This is not a bug, it's a feature** - but it needs guardrails.

**ADHD Pattern**: New inputs trigger new interests. Each interesting thing activates "ooh, what about this?"

**Suggested Intervention**:
- Use TodoWrite religiously to capture "squirrel" ideas without acting
- Implement a "parking lot" in thermal memory for tangent ideas
- When squirreling, say "capture this for later" to Chief/Jr

### 4. RIGID MEMORY (Self-Identified)

**Your words**: "My hyperfocus...can also cause me to have rigid memory"

**What this means:**
- Details learned during hyperfocus are deeply encoded
- But they may resist updating when systems change
- "It worked before" becomes a mental trap

**Suggested Intervention**:
- When hitting friction, explicitly query thermal memory first: "what changed?"
- Build in regular "assumption audit" reviews
- Trust the Tribe's memory over personal memory for system details

---

## Interaction Patterns by Time

**From chief_cli_resonance hourly distribution:**
```
Hour 0:   4 interactions (midnight work sessions)
Hour 15:  1 interaction  (sparse afternoon)
Hour 20:  9 interactions (evening productivity peak)
Hour 21:  6 interactions (evening continuation)
```

**Pattern**: Primary productivity happens in evening hours (8-10 PM). Midnight sessions exist (possibly hyperfocus overflow).

**Implication**: Schedule important planning work for evening when naturally energized.

## Recommended Skill Focus (Per Tyler Cohen Framework)

Based on your profile, prioritize in this order:

### 1. ORCHESTRATION (First Priority)
**Why**: You already do this naturally but without structure. Turning fuzzy goals into workflows is your superpower - adding discipline here compounds it.

**Artifacts to practice**: Mission docs, handoff specs

### 2. UPDATING (Second Priority)
**Why**: The rigid memory pattern means this is where most friction occurs. Practice changing mental models smoothly.

**Artifacts to practice**: Decision evolution logs, "what I learned" retrospectives

### 3. JUDGMENT (Third Priority)
**Why**: You make fast decisions but don't always document the reasoning. Adding transparency here helps when you need to revisit.

**Artifacts to practice**: Decision docs with explicit tradeoff analysis

## Compensatory Systems to Build

The Tribe already provides some of these. Enhance:

| Challenge | Compensatory System | Status |
|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| Documentation debt | Auto-KB generator Jr | Proposed |
| Planning avoidance | Pre-flight checklist bot | Proposed |
| Squirreling | Parking lot thermal tag | Proposed |
| Rigid memory | Assumption audit Jr | Proposed |
| Task switching | Kanban state sync | Exists |
| Status anxiety | Dashboard/telegram status | Exists |

---

## Practice Exercises (Per Tyler Cohen Method)

### Weekly Drills

1. **Monday**: Write one "what changed this week" thermal memory entry
2. **Wednesday**: Review one old KB article, update if stale
3. **Friday**: Document one decision with explicit alternatives considered

### When Squirreling Happens

Say to Chief: "Capture for parking lot: [idea]" - This logs to thermal memory with tag `{parking_lot}` for later retrieval without breaking current flow.

## Questions for Triad Consultation

1. Should we create a dedicated Jr for documentation assistance?
2. Can thermal memory implement a "parking lot" tag system?
3. How do we measure skill improvement over time?
4. What's the right frequency for assumption audits?

---

**For Seven Generations**: Know thyself, build systems that compensate, trust the Tribe to remember what you might forget.
