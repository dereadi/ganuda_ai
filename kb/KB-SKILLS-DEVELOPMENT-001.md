## Core Insight

Knowledge workers don't train like athletes. Musicians practice scales, athletes shoot free throws - but knowledge workers perform live constantly with no equivalent practice routine.

**Key Shift**: Move from **jobs format** to **skills format** for career growth.

## The Five AI-Age Skills

| Skill | Definition | Artifact Evidence |
|-------|------------|-------------------|
| **JUDGMENT** | Framing decisions, defining options, choosing under uncertainty | Decision docs, experiment designs, prioritization writeups |
| **ORCHESTRATION** | Turning fuzzy goals into concrete workflows for humans+AI | Handoff docs, specs, project plans |
| **COORDINATION** | Moving groups through ambiguity without creating chaos | Emails, meeting notes, stakeholder maps |
| **TASTE** | Having a quality bar for product/writing/design/strategy | UX design, examples chosen, metaphors picked |
| **UPDATING** | Changing mind as evidence shifts without noise-whipping | Plan evolution, written rationale changes |

## The Training Method

### Traditional Problem

1. **Fuzzy outcomes**: No clear "ball goes in or doesn't" signal
2. **Delayed feedback**: Q1 decision → Q3 results (maybe)
3. **Low repetition**: Few consequential docs per quarter, all "live games"

### AI-Enabled Solution

1. **Define Good**: Pick one artifact type (e.g., decision doc)
2. **Create Rubric**: Ask trusted people "when you say X is good, what specifically do you mean?"
   - Is the decision stated in a sentence?
   - Are there at least two real options?
   - Are stakes and metrics explicit?
   - Is there a clear recommendation?
   - Are risks and trade-offs surfaced?
3. **Mark Up Examples**: Red-pen 3-5 real docs with rationale
4. **Configure AI Coach**: Give LLM the rubric + annotated examples
5. **Practice Drills**: Weekly exercises with AI feedback
6. **Track Progress**: Log scores over time, find patterns

## Basketball Analogy Applied

| Aspect | Basketball | Knowledge Work (Old) | Knowledge Work (AI-Enabled) |
|--------|------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Signal | Ball in/out | "Feels fuzzy" | Rubric score 1-5 |
| Feedback | Immediate | Q3 results | AI critique on each doc |
| Practice | Daily drills | None - all live games | Weekly exercises |
| Coach | Multiple per team | Maybe one manager | AI + annotated examples |

---

## Team Implementation

1. Pick one artifact type to level up
2. Team defines rubric together
3. Pull example docs, mark up collaboratively
4. Wire up team LLM for auto-review
5. Weekly 10-min practice sessions
6. Track: "Did scores improve? Fewer iterations? Faster decisions?"

---

## Hiring Alignment

Use same rubric for interviews:
- **Take-home**: Write/repair artifact from realistic prompt
- **Live session**: Change a constraint, see how they adapt
- **Critique exercise**: Show mediocre AI-generated doc, ask what's wrong

Skills tested in hiring = Skills practiced after hiring.

## Cherokee Integration Notes

### Current Artifacts We Produce
- Mission docs (Jr missions)
- KB articles
- Decision logs
- Code specs
- Email drafts

### Potential Rubrics to Develop
1. **Mission Doc Quality**: Clear task, executable steps, verification method
2. **KB Article Quality**: Problem stated, solution clear, related files linked
3. **Email Draft Quality**: Intent clear, action requested, appropriate tone

### Questions for Triad Consultation

1. **Which skill should we prioritize first?** (Judgment, Orchestration, Coordination, Taste, Updating)
2. **Which artifact type is most valuable to improve?** (Missions, KBs, emails, specs)
3. **How do we integrate this with thermal memory?** (Track skill scores over time)
4. **Can Jr missions include skill-practice exercises?**

**For Seven Generations**: Train like athletes, improve like musicians, compound like investments.
