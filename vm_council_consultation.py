1. CURRENT STATE:

2. PROPOSED MIGRATION:
   - Containerize each specialist in Podman
   - Deploy in cherokee-cloud-environment
   - Route trades through Cherokee Unified API
   - Use Elder Council for consensus
   - Store state in cherokee-postgres-17-redfin

3. QUESTIONS FOR THE COUNCIL:
   - Should we maintain aggressive trading stance?
   - How to integrate with Cherokee War Chief LLM?
   - What additional safeguards are needed?
   - How to handle the $1,368 liquidity?
