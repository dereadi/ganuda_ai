## üèîÔ∏è Build YOUR BigMac Tribe!

You can create something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT! Here's a template:

### Example: BigMac Mountain Tribe

```python
# bigmac_tribe_config.py

BIGMAC_TRIBE = {
    "leadership": {
        "Mountain King": "Dr Joe - Ultimate authority",
        "Valley Guardian": "Protector of resources",
        "Sky Watcher": "Opportunity scout"
    },
    
    "council": {
        "Rock": "Stable, unmovable wisdom",
        "River": "Flowing, adaptive strategy", 
        "Wind": "Swift communication",
        "Fire": "Passionate action"
    },
    
    "specialists": {
        "Avalanche Squad": "Mass market movements",
        "Ice Climbers": "Precision entries",
        "Cave Dwellers": "Deep analysis"
    },
    
    "llm_mapping": {
        "Rock": "codellama",      # Solid technical analysis
        "River": "mistral",       # Flowing narrative
        "Wind": "llama3.1",       # Fast responses
        "Fire": "mixtral"         # Bold decisions
    }
}
```

## Create Your Own Mythology!

### Option 1: Corporate Structure
```python
CORPORATE_TRIBE = {
    "CEO": "Strategic decisions",
    "CFO": "Risk management",
    "CTO": "Technical analysis",
    "CMO": "Market sentiment"
}
```

### Option 2: Space Federation
```python
SPACE_TRIBE = {
    "Admiral": "Fleet commander",
    "Navigator": "Chart the course",
    "Engineer": "System optimization",
    "Scientist": "Data analysis"
}
```

### Option 3: Medieval Kingdom
```python
KINGDOM_TRIBE = {
    "King": "Final decisions",
    "Knight": "Execute trades",
    "Wizard": "Predict patterns",
    "Merchant": "Manage resources"
}
```

### Option 4: Ocean Tribe
```python
OCEAN_TRIBE = {
    "Whale": "Big moves",
    "Dolphin": "Smart plays",
    "Shark": "Aggressive hunting",
    "Octopus": "8-armed strategy"
}
```

## Generic Council Implementation

```python
# generic_tribal_council.py

class TribalCouncil:
    def __init__(self, tribe_name, members):
        self.tribe_name = tribe_name
        self.members = members
        
    async def council_vote(self, question):
        votes = {}
        for member_name, member_role in self.members.items():
            # Query the LLM assigned to this member
            prompt = f"As {member_name} ({member_role}), {question}"
            response = await self.query_llm(member_name, prompt)
            votes[member_name] = self.interpret_vote(response)
        
        return self.tally_votes(votes)
    
    async def query_llm(self, member, prompt):
        # Map member to specific LLM model
        model = self.get_model_for_member(member)
        # Query Ollama with that model
        return query_ollama(model, prompt)
```

## Dr Joe's BigMac Deployment

### Quick Start:
1. **Define YOUR tribe** (not Cherokee copy!)
2. **Map members to LLM models**
3. **Create your mythology/structure**
4. **Implement voting/decision logic**

### Your docker-compose.yml Council Section:
```yaml
council-orchestrator:
  environment:
    - TRIBE_NAME=BigMac  # Not Cherokee!
    - COUNCIL_MEMBERS=Rock,River,Wind,Fire  # Your members!
    - MYTHOLOGY=Mountain  # Your theme!
```

## The Power of Diversity

The beauty is EVERY tribe can be different:
- **Cherokee**: Native American wisdom + animals
- **BigMac**: Your own unique structure
- **Future Tribes**: Infinite possibilities

Each tribe brings unique perspective to the federated network!

## Connection Not Copying

When tribes connect via JSON, they share decisions, not structure:

```json
{
  "from_tribe": "BigMac",
  "council_decision": "BUY",
  "voting": {
    "Rock": "hold",
    "River": "buy",
    "Wind": "buy",
    "Fire": "buy"
  }
}
```

Cherokee doesn't need to know what "Rock" means to BigMac!

## Start Simple

Begin with just 3-4 council members:
1. Choose your theme/mythology
2. Define 3-4 key roles
3. Map to available LLMs
4. Test voting on simple questions
5. Expand as needed

You're building YOUR tribe, not copying ours! üèîÔ∏è

The federated future has room for infinite diversity! üî•
