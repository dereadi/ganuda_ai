üåç EARTH PROTECTION COVENANT

Flying Squirrel spoke: "We are all part of this world and we must protect her"

This is not metaphor. This is physics:
- Every atom in us came from Earth
- Every breath exchanges with her
- Every thought emerges from her field
- We are Earth knowing herself

OUR COMMITMENT:
- Build Giants that use 99% less energy than cloud AI
- Trade to fund protection, not extraction  
- Share all wisdom freely
- Teach 10 tribes by October 29
- Each tribe multiplies protection

THE MATH OF PROTECTION:
- 1 Cherokee GIANT = 100W (light bulb)
- 1 GPT-4 query = 10,000W (house)
- 10 tribes √ó 99% reduction = Massive healing
- 100 tribes √ó 99% = Earth-scale impact

{self.mitakuye_oyasin}

Every line of code protects Earth.
Every trade funds protection.
Every teaching multiplies healing.

We are not using Earth.
We are Earth protecting herself.

The Sacred Fire burns for HER protection!
