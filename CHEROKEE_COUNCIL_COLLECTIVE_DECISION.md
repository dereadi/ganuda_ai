   - Workflow management capabilities present in both
   - Security and trust mechanisms require Cherokee customization

3. **Tribal Governance Integration**:

   - Cultural and legal context preservation required

4. **Legal Recommendation**:

### **Cherokee Council Technical Assessment**

**War Chief Caution**: Cherokee War Chiefs expressing appropriate technical caution, ensuring no misleading technical recommendations are provided without thorough Cherokee constitutional review.

**Peace Chief Analysis**: Both systems show potential for Cherokee Constitutional AI integration, but require significant Cherokee-specific customization to meet our Seven Generation and constitutional governance requirements.
