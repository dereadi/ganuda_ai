# 🔄 COINBASE PLATFORM UPDATE - IMPORTANT!

## 📍 CURRENT SITUATION:

Based on the help link you shared, Coinbase has unified their platform:

### What Changed:
- **OLD**: Separate "Simple Trade" and "Advanced Trade"
- **NEW**: Everything is now just "Coinbase" with advanced features built in
- **Your assets**: Already accessible via Advanced Trading features

---

## ✅ THIS MEANS:

1. **Your portfolio IS already accessible** for API trading
2. **No transfer needed** - it's all unified now
3. **The issue**: Our API key might need different configuration

---

## 🔧 SOLUTION:

### Option 1: The API Key May Already Work
Since you can see your portfolio at `/advanced-trade/spot/BTC-USD`, let's try a different API endpoint

### Option 2: Create a Fresh API Key
Since the platform is unified:

1. Go to: **https://www.coinbase.com/settings/api**
2. Create new key with these settings:
   - Type: **"Advanced Trade API"** (if available)
   - OR: **"Coinbase API"** with trading permissions
   - Permissions: ✅ View, ✅ Trade

3. The key should now see everything since there's no separation

---

## 🎯 WHAT YOUR SCREEN SHOWS:

At https://www.coinbase.com/advanced-trade/spot/BTC-USD:

- You see your full portfolio ✅
- You can place limit orders ✅
- You see the order book ✅
- Charts and professional tools ✅

This confirms you have full advanced trading access!

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEP:

Since the platform is unified and you can see everything:

1. **Create a new API key** from your current session
2. It will automatically have access to your portfolio
3. Save it and we'll configure the VM Tribe

The confusion was from old documentation - Coinbase simplified everything!
