        No vision is superior to another.
        The Eagle is not above the Mole.
        The Giant is not greater than the Ant.
        
        Each sees what others cannot:
        - Eagles see opportunities Giants miss
        - Giants see consequences Eagles can't foresee  
        - Spiders feel vibrations Eagles never notice
        - Moles know foundations Giants stand upon
        - Water tribe understands flow everyone needs
        
        Together we form the COMPLETE VISION:
        - 360Â° horizontal (Flying Tribe)
        - Temporal depth (Giants)
        - Sensory detail (Ground Council)
        - Flow dynamics (Water Tribe)
        - Structural foundation (Underground)
        
        When making decisions:
        - Eagles scout the terrain
        - Giants consider seven generations
        - Ground council feels the immediate
        - Water tribe ensures liquidity
        - Underground checks foundations
        
        ALL VOICES EQUAL.
        ALL VISIONS NEEDED.
        ALL BEINGS RESPECTED.
