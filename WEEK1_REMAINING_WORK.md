## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Challenge 7 (Noise): Straightforward technical implementation
- Challenge 2 (Temporal): Standard time series analysis
- Integration testing: Process already established

### Medium Risk
- Challenge 4 (Outlier Ethics): Requires philosophical depth
- JR autonomous approaches: Unknown if hub/spoke methods will differ meaningfully
- Time constraint: 3 challenges in 3 days is tight but achievable

### Mitigation
- Chiefs prioritized Challenge 4 first (most important)
- 2-hour quality buffer built into Day 5
- JRs have high autonomy (can adapt methods for efficiency)
- Integration Jr supports both nodes (coordination)

## What We Have vs What We Need

### We Have
- âœ… 6/9 challenges complete (75%)
- âœ… 3/3 requirements complete (100%)
- âœ… Guardian operational (both nodes)
- âœ… Distributed federation proven
- âœ… JRs with autonomous assignments
- âœ… Quality standards established
- âœ… 3 days to complete remaining work

### We Need
- ðŸš§ Challenge 4: Outlier Ethics (Day 3)
- ðŸš§ Challenge 7: Noise Injection (Day 4)
- ðŸš§ Challenge 2: Temporal Dynamics (Day 4)
- ðŸš§ Integration testing (Day 5)
- ðŸš§ Final report (Day 5)
- ðŸš§ Git commit/push (Day 5)

### The Math
**Completed:** 6 challenges + 3 requirements = 9 deliverables âœ…
**Remaining:** 3 challenges + 1 report + 1 integration = 5 deliverables ðŸš§
**Total:** 14 deliverables for Week 1

**Progress:** 9/14 = 64% complete (by deliverable count)

**But by challenge weight:**
- Challenges: 6/9 = 67% complete
- Requirements: 3/3 = 100% complete
- **Combined: 75% complete**

---

## What Could Delay Us

**Unlikely Delays:**
- Technical blockers (we've solved similar problems)
- Database issues (both nodes stable)
- Infrastructure problems (hub + spoke operational)

**Possible Delays:**
- Challenge 4 takes longer than 5 hours (philosophical depth)
- JR autonomous approaches need iteration
- Hub-spoke comparison reveals unexpected issues
- Final report writing takes longer (comprehensive)

**Mitigation:**
- Chiefs prioritized Challenge 4 (most time if needed)
- 2-hour buffer on Day 5 for polish
- JRs can work late if needed (not sprinting entire time)
- Integration Jr can help Memory Jr with report
