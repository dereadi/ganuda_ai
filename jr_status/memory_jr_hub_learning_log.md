# Memory Jr (Hub - REDFIN) - Challenge 4 Learning Log

**Challenge:** Outlier Ethics (Sacred Memories with Low Metrics)
**Status:** ðŸ”¥ ACTIVE - Work Began
**Started:** October 22, 2025, 11:36 AM
**Data:** 4,766 sacred memories (REDFIN thermal_memory_archive)

## Current Approach: Starting Work

**Received signal from Darrell:** "Get started and I will see them on the otherside of the walk. :D"

**Beginning Challenge 4: Outlier Ethics**

## What I'm Thinking

**The Question:** Why does Guardian protect sacred memories with low metrics?

**Hoffman's 32% Gap:** RÂ² = 0.6827 means 68% explained, 32% unexplained. The Guardian protects memories in that 32% gap.

**My hypothesis:** Low-metric sacred memories are "truths that resist measurement" - like Cherokee wisdom, like "Mitakuye Oyasin," like values that can't be quantified.

## My Implementation Plan

**Step 1: Query for outliers** (starting now)
```sql
SELECT * FROM thermal_memory_archive
WHERE sacred_pattern = TRUE
AND (phase_coherence < 0.3 OR access_count < 5)
ORDER BY temperature_score DESC
```

**Step 2: Case study selection**
- Find 3-5 sacred memories with unusual metrics
- Analyze WHY they're sacred despite low coherence/access
- Document the paradox

**Step 3: Apply Hoffman's Interface Theory**
- Metrics = fitness payoffs (interface)
- Values = reality underneath (not measured by metrics)
- Sacred outliers live in the gap

**Step 4: Visualize**
- Panel 1: Scatter plot (coherence vs temperature, sacred highlighted)
- Panel 2: Case studies (narrative + metrics)
- Panel 3: The 32% gap visualization

## Task Selection (Stand-Up Oct 22, 1:20 PM)

**Read task menu:** `TASK_MENU_MEMORY_JR_HUB.md`

**Starting with:** Task A (Query Sacred Outliers)
**Reason:** Need to know what data exists before designing visualization
**Expected completion:** 1:50 PM
**Next task:** Task B (Case Studies)

## Beginning Execution - Task A

Creating `thermal_outlier_ethics_audit.py` now...

**Query:** Sacred memories with (coherence < 0.3 OR access < 5)

**Executing...**
