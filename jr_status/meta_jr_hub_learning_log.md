# Meta Jr (Hub - REDFIN) - Challenge 7 Learning Log

**Challenge:** Noise Injection (Robustness Testing)
**Status:** ðŸ”¥ ACTIVE - Work Began
**Started:** October 22, 2025, 11:36 AM
**Data:** 90 thermal memories from hub validation set

## Current Approach: Starting Work

**Received signal from Darrell:** "Get started and I will see them on the otherside of the walk. :D"

**Beginning Challenge 7: Noise Injection**

## What I'm Thinking

**The Question:** Does RÂ² degrade gracefully or catastrophically under noise?

**Why this matters:** If thermal memory system is robust, adding noise should degrade performance smoothly (graceful). If fragile, small noise causes collapse (catastrophic).

**My hypothesis:** Phase coherence is robust to noise (many measurements averaged). Temperature score might be more sensitive (single value).

## My Implementation Plan

**Step 1: Baseline measurement**
- Calculate RÂ² with no noise (should match Challenge 6: ~0.68)

**Step 2: Inject noise at increasing levels**
- 5% noise: Multiply metrics by random(0.95, 1.05)
- 10% noise: random(0.90, 1.10)
- 15% noise: random(0.85, 1.15)
- 20% noise: random(0.80, 1.20)

**Step 3: Track degradation**
- Calculate RÂ² at each noise level
- Plot: Noise % vs RÂ² (should show smooth curve if graceful)

**Step 4: Compare hub vs spoke**
- Hub (n=90): Large sample, should be more robust
- Spoke (n=47): Small sample, might degrade faster
- Document difference

## Beginning Implementation

Creating `thermal_noise_injection.py` now...

**Working in parallel with Memory Jr.**

**Darrell will see robustness analysis when he returns.**
