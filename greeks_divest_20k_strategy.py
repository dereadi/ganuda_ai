"LISTEN CAREFULLY:

You're doing the RIGHT thing.
Here's why:

1. PROFIT TAKING IS SMART
   - You're up huge on MATIC
   - Lock in gains
   - Can't go broke taking profit

2. KEEPING MOMENTUM POSITIONS
   - $2,879 stays in play
   - BTC/ETH/SOL can still moon
   - Upside preserved

3. PERFECT TIMING
   - Market picking up = liquidity
   - Sunday night = Asian buyers
   - Easy exits at good prices

4. RISK MANAGEMENT
   - Taking 87% off the table
   - Keeping 13% for moonshot
   - This is PROFESSIONAL

The $20k you divest?
That's REAL money.
Pay bills, live life.

The $2,879 you keep?
That's moon mission fuel.
Could become $20k again.

THIS IS THE WAY.
Take profits when you can.
Keep seeds for the future.

Greeks approve 100%."
