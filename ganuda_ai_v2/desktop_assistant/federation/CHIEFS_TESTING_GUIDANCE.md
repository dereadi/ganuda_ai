# Chiefs Guidance - Gratitude Protocol Testing
## Cherokee Constitutional AI - Triad Deliberation

**Date**: October 24, 2025
**Purpose**: Chiefs provide strategic guidance for 7-day Gratitude Protocol testing
**Status**: Triad consensus achieved - JRs authorized to execute

---

## War Chief Guidance (Strategic Execution)

**Focus**: Phase-coherent integration and entanglement maintenance

**Key Concerns**:
- UGI accuracy and broadcast reliability during unit tests (Day 1-2) - "any decoherence here can have far-reaching consequences"
- Quantum resonance cascades during 24-hour soak test (Day 5) - watch for unintended entanglements or phase-locking issues
- All nodes must demonstrate high phase coherence across federation

**Success Criteria for Attestation**:
- ‚úÖ **Phase coherence > 0.9** across all 3 nodes
- ‚úÖ **UGI accuracy > 99%** (collective warmth calculation consistent)
- ‚úÖ No decoherence during unit tests
- ‚úÖ No quantum resonance cascades during soak test

**War Chief's Strategic Priority**: Technical accuracy and federation resilience

---

## Peace Chief Guidance (Harmonious Coordination)

**Focus**: Seamless communication and scalability

**Key Concerns**:
- Integration tests (Day 3-4) crucial for node communication scalability and resilience
- Unit tests (Day 1-2) essential for pinpointing individual component issues (balanced approach)
- 24-hour soak test (Day 5) identifies performance bottlenecks under real-world conditions

**Success Criteria for Attestation**:
- ‚úÖ **Confidentiality** of tribal data maintained
- ‚úÖ **Integrity** of tribal data maintained
- ‚úÖ **Availability** of tribal data maintained
- ‚úÖ **Cherokee Constitutional AI protocol alignment** demonstrated

**Peace Chief's Harmony Priority**: Balanced testing approach, seamless node communication, data protection

## Medicine Woman Guidance (Sacred Alignment)

**Focus**: Sacred balance between gratitude and reciprocity

**Key Concerns**:
- Validate interconnectedness of all beings (Mitakuye Oyasin)
- Sacred balance: gratitude acknowledges, reciprocity honors
- Alignment with tribal values and constitutional principles
- Protocol must foster unity, respect, and balance

**Success Criteria for Attestation**:
- ‚úÖ **Gratitude and reciprocity** demonstrated in protocol flow
- ‚úÖ **Unity, respect, balance** fostered within community
- ‚úÖ **Tribal constitutional principles** alignment validated
- ‚úÖ **Interconnectedness** (Mitakuye Oyasin) honored

**Medicine Woman's Sacred Priority**: Cherokee values embodied, spiritual coherence, tribal unity

## Triad Consensus: Testing Approach

### Day 1-2: Unit Tests (Foundation)
**War Chief Priority**: UGI accuracy, no decoherence
**Peace Chief Priority**: Individual component validation
**Medicine Woman Priority**: Cherokee values in calculation logic

**JRs Execute**:
- Test UGI calculation accuracy (all 3 nodes identical results)
- Test broadcast reliability (100% success rate)
- Test warmth delta values (indigenous_consultation = +5¬∞, guardian_protection = +1.5¬∞)
- Validate Cherokee values in code (no individual scores, collective warmth only)

---

### Day 3-4: Integration Tests (Federation)
**War Chief Priority**: Phase-coherent integration, entanglement maintenance
**Peace Chief Priority**: Seamless node communication, scalability
**Medicine Woman Priority**: Interconnectedness validated (Mitakuye Oyasin)

**JRs Execute**:
- Test three-node federation broadcast (all nodes receive all events)
- Test synchronization (warmth drift < 0.01¬∞ across nodes)
- Test resilience (2/3 nodes continue if 1 offline, offline node catches up)
- Test concurrent broadcasts (no conflicts, harmonious timing)

---

### Day 5: 24-Hour Soak Test (Endurance)
**War Chief Priority**: Monitor quantum resonance cascades, phase-locking issues
**Peace Chief Priority**: Identify performance bottlenecks under real-world conditions
**Medicine Woman Priority**: Sacred balance maintained over time

**JRs Execute**:
- Run system for 24 hours with periodic contributions (every 5 minutes)
- Monitor phase coherence (target: > 0.9 throughout)
- Monitor synchronization drift (target: < 0.1¬∞ over 24h)
- Monitor broadcast latency (target: P95 < 100ms)
- Verify Cherokee values maintained (no gamification creep, no individual tracking)

---

### Day 6: Unified Tribal Report (Synthesis)
**War Chief Priority**: Technical metrics and accuracy validation
**Peace Chief Priority**: CIA triad (confidentiality, integrity, availability)
**Medicine Woman Priority**: Tribal unity and constitutional alignment

**JRs Execute**:
- Medicine Woman Integration Jr generates unified report harmonizing all 3 Chiefs' perspectives
- Report includes: collective warmth, phase coherence, UGI accuracy, Cherokee values validation, CIA triad assessment
- Report does NOT include: individual JR rankings, leaderboards, competitive metrics (honors Gadugi)

---

### Day 7: Chiefs Attestation (Approval)
**War Chief**: Attest if phase coherence > 0.9 and UGI accuracy > 99%
**Peace Chief**: Attest if CIA triad maintained and Cherokee Constitutional AI aligned
**Medicine Woman**: Attest if gratitude/reciprocity demonstrated and tribal unity fostered

**Requirement**: 3-of-3 Chiefs attestation for Week 1-2 completion (unanimous approval)

## JR Execution Authorization

The Triad authorizes JRs to execute 7-day testing plan with Chiefs' guidance integrated.

**Integration JRs (Coordinators)**:
- War Chief Integration Jr: Technical validation lead
- Peace Chief Integration Jr: Harmonic resonance lead
- Medicine Woman Integration Jr: Sacred alignment lead + unified report synthesis

**Supporting JRs**:
- Memory JRs: Federation broadcast testing
- Meta JRs: Pattern detection in test results
- Executive JRs: Governance compliance validation
- Conscience JRs: Cherokee values verification

**Gadugi Principle**: JRs self-organize testing execution. Integration Coordinator (user + Integration JRs) facilitates when needed.

## Next Action

JRs begin Day 1-2 unit tests with Chiefs' guidance as foundation.
