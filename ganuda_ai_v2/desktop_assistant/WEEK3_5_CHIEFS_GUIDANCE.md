## üåø Medicine Woman Conscience Jr - C1: Sacred Health Data Protocol

**Strategic Approach** (EXCLUSIVE FOCUS):

### Entity Detection
"I will utilize spaCy's NER capabilities to identify medical entities with high precision, ensuring accurate identification of sensitive health data."

### 40¬∞ Floor Enforcement
"I will configure the system to automatically elevate all medical data to 'sacred-by-default' status upon recognition of any medical entity, regardless of user input."

### Biometric Data Handling
"Biometric data will be handled separately, requiring explicit 3-of-3 Chiefs attestation before processing or sharing, ensuring an additional layer of protection. I will implement a unique flag that signals the system to apply enhanced security measures, such as encryption and stricter access controls."

### Minimal Data Validation
"Minimal data validation will involve real-time verification against our established Cherokee cultural principles, ensuring collected data aligns with our values."

### User Deletion Controls
"I will integrate user deletion controls to allow individuals to request removal of their medical data from our system, upholding our commitment to protecting sacred knowledge and respecting individual autonomy."

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Multi-layered approach respecting Cherokee values
- spaCy NER for medical entity detection
- Automatic sacred-by-default elevation
- Biometric flag for 3-of-3 attestation
- Real-time Cherokee values validation
- User autonomy through deletion controls

## üåø Medicine Woman Executive Jr - E2: Sacred Health Data Attestation

**Strategic Approach** (PRIMARY FOCUS):

### Attestation Workflow Trigger
"The attestation workflow will be triggered by a request from authorized personnel to access health data, which will initiate a notification to the 3 Chiefs for their review."

### Chiefs Review Process
"The 2-of-3 Chiefs will review the request through a secure, encrypted portal, where they'll assess the need-to-know criteria and evaluate the risk level of the data sharing. Chiefs can reject requests that don't meet the necessary approval thresholds or if there's insufficient justification."

### Integration with C1 Guardian
"I'll configure the attestation workflow to run automated checks against our tribal database for any adverse actions taken by the requesting personnel, such as previous unauthorized access attempts or data breaches. This will ensure that only legitimate and trusted individuals can access sensitive health information."

### Final Verification & Audit
"Once the 2-of-3 Chiefs have approved the request, it will be forwarded to C1 Guardian for final verification before the data sharing occurs. The attestation process will also include a comprehensive audit trail, capturing all interactions and decisions made during the workflow."

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Multi-step workflow with notifications
- Secure, encrypted portal for Chiefs review
- Need-to-know and risk assessment
- Automated background checks via tribal database
- C1 Guardian final verification
- Comprehensive audit trail

## üïäÔ∏è Peace Chief Integration Jr - I2: Transparency Dashboard

**Strategic Approach** (PRIMARY FOCUS):

### Architecture Pattern
"We will employ a microservices-based architecture, where each module is responsible for a specific function, ensuring modularity and scalability."

### UI Design
"The UI will be designed using a responsive framework, providing an intuitive interface for users to navigate and access relevant information."

### Backend Integration
"For backend integration, we'll utilize RESTful APIs to connect with M1 (provenance) and A3 (flow viz), enabling seamless data exchange and visualization."

### Modular Design
"Our dashboard architecture will be built using a modular design pattern, allowing for easy updates and maintenance of individual components without disrupting the overall system. This approach will also facilitate future integrations with other modules and systems."

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Microservices architecture (modularity + scalability)
- Responsive UI framework (intuitive navigation)
- RESTful APIs for M1/A3 integration
- Modular components (easy updates)
- Future-proof (adaptable for new integrations)
