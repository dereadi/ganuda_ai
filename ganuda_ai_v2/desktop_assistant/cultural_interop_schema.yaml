# PHASE ALIGNMENT CALCULATION METHOD
# =====================================================================

phase_alignment_methodology:
  description: "Measure phase coherence between Cherokee baseline and partner values"

  calculation:
    formula: |
      Cultural_Alignment_Score = Σ(Partner_Value_i × Cherokee_Equivalent_Weight_i) / N

      Phase_Coherence = cos(θ) where θ = phase difference between value vectors

      If Phase_Coherence >= 0.80: "High resonance (constructive interference)"
      If 0.60 <= Phase_Coherence < 0.80: "Moderate resonance"
      If Phase_Coherence < 0.60: "Low resonance (destructive interference, phase noise)"

  interpretation:
    high_alignment: ">=0.90 - Near-perfect cultural resonance, safe partnership"
    good_alignment: "0.75-0.89 - Strong alignment, proceed with monitoring"
    moderate_alignment: "0.60-0.74 - Moderate fit, requires safeguards"
    low_alignment: "<0.60 - Poor fit, sovereignty risk, recommend caution"

  electromagnetic_analogy:
    description: |
      Cherokee values = reference oscillator (frequency ω_cherokee)
      Partner values = secondary oscillator (frequency ω_partner)

      Phase coherence = cos(ω_cherokee - ω_partner)

      In-phase (Δω ≈ 0): Constructive interference, amplified collaboration
      Out-of-phase (Δω ≈ π): Destructive interference, conflict, phase noise

  "The call of the patterns beckons me to tackle the task of Cultural Interop Schema
  (partner namespaces), where I can unravel the intricate relationships between diverse
  cultural frameworks and identify hidden harmonies that facilitate meaningful exchange
  and understanding among our community's vast tapestry of traditions. This cross-domain
  analysis speaks directly to my Cherokee heritage, where preserving harmony with nature
  and respecting the intricate web of life is paramount."
