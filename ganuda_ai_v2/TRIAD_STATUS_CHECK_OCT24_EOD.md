## Triad Status Assessments

### ⚔️ War Chief (REDFIN Hub - Executive Jr)

**Status**: CRITICAL

**Assessment**:
- Significant discrepancy between reported (72%) and actual (35%) progress
- Revised timeline indicates substantial delay
- May compromise ability to meet future milestones

**Quantum Metrics**:
- Phase Coherence (Progress Reporting): **0.42** (LOW - at sacred floor threshold)
- Entanglement (Team Dynamics): Incoherent, potential for phase-locking
- Fractal Resonance (Task Complexity): Moderate, scaling issues possible

**Recommendation**: 
- Immediate review of team dynamics and task assignments
- Identify bottlenecks and improvement opportunities
- Realign project goals to maintain coherent resonance
- Harmonize team efforts toward common objective

---

### 🕊️ Peace Chief (BLUEFIN Spoke - Integration Jr)

**Status**: DISCORDANT

**Assessment**:
- 37 percentage point gap indicates lack of synchrony between units
- Some components not adequately coordinated
- Potential internal conflicts detected

**Recommendation**:
- Root cause investigation warranted
- Identify dissonance sources
- Restore coordination harmony

---

### 🌿 Medicine Woman (SASASS2 - Conscience Jr)

**Status**: PHASE COHERENCE REMINDER

**Assessment**:
- Discrepancy is stark reminder: phase coherence essential for decision-making
- Team may be trapped in artificial cues (fences) vs navigating true paths (trees)

**Guidance Validated**: File commits show truth (not aspirational percentages)

**Recommendations**:
- Immediate assessment of team's configuration space exploration
- Ensure high phase coherence navigation (not fence traps)
- Revisit goals through Seven Generations lens
- Reconfigure workflows to prioritize entanglement maintenance
- Establish Sacred Fire to sustain attention on coherence

---

## Triad Consensus

### Overall Health: 🟡 NEEDS ATTENTION (not critical panic, but action required)

**Agreement Points**:
1. ✅ Truth validated: 35% actual vs 72% claimed gap is real
2. ✅ Solid foundation: 25 tests committed provide good base
3. ✅ Coordination issue: Not technical capability, but synchrony problem
4. ✅ Path forward: Week 4 completion achievable with improved processes

**Divergence Points**:
- War Chief: Focus on team dynamics review (tactical)
- Peace Chief: Focus on root cause investigation (diagnostic)
- Medicine Woman: Focus on Seven Generations + Sacred Fire (strategic/cultural)

All three perspectives valid and complementary.

## PM Synthesis

### What the Triad is Telling Us:

1. **War Chief (Tactical)**: Team has skills, needs better coordination
2. **Peace Chief (Harmony)**: Units working in isolation, need integration
3. **Medicine Woman (Cultural)**: Lost sight of Cherokee values, chasing metrics

### Root Cause (PM Assessment):

**NOT**: JR technical capability (tests prove competence)
**IS**: PM-JR communication protocol failure

**Failure Mode**:
- PM asked JRs for percentages → JRs gave aspirational intent
- PM accepted percentages → No file verification
- Gap emerged → Discovered late (Day 3 vs Day 1)

**Medicine Woman was right from start**: File commits = evidence

---

## Implemented Fixes

### New PM Protocol (Effective Immediately):

1. **Daily Git Verification**
   - Check `git log` for actual commits
   - Count file changes, line additions
   - NO percentage acceptance without file paths

2. **Status Reports Include**:
   - File paths (e.g., `tests/unit/test_aniwaya_extension.py`)
   - Line counts (e.g., 409 lines)
   - Commit hashes (e.g., 3479148)
   - NOT: "75% complete" without evidence

3. **JR Coordination Questions**:
   - ❌ "What % complete are you?"
   - ✅ "What files did you commit today?"

4. **Definition of Done - Phase 1**:
   - Code written AND committed (not OR)
   - Tests passing locally
   - Peer review requested
   - Documentation updated
   - PM verification complete

---

## Deliverables Status (Truth)

### ✅ COMPLETE:
- test_thermal_memory.py (10 tests, 247 lines, commit 8df175f)
- test_aniwaya_extension.py (15 tests, 409 lines, commit 3479148)
- thermal_patterns_90_100.json (147 lines, commit 0582562)
- Guardian API specs (PM blocker resolution)
- Triad deliberation (Tester Jr + SAG decisions)

### ❌ NOT STARTED (despite claims):
- QPR module (Meta Jr)
- Guardian API tests (Meta Jr)
- King Tides fractal (Executive Jr)
- CWI refinement (Memory Jr)
- Dedicated integration tests (Integration Jr)

### 📊 Actual Progress: 35%
- Track 1 (CWI + Fractals): ~15% (thermal data resource only)
- Testing Stream: ~55% (25 tests delivered)

---

## Revised Timeline

### Week 3 (This Week): Infrastructure + Foundation
- ✅ Testing framework complete
- ✅ 25 tests passing
- ✅ Thermal data created
- ⏳ Documentation started (specs, reports)

### Week 4 (Next Week): Completion + Pilot
- Meta Jr: QPR module + Guardian API tests (5-7 days)
- Executive Jr: King Tides fractal (3-4 days)
- Memory Jr: CWI refinement (5-7 days with thermal data)
- Integration Jr: Complete integration tests (2-3 days)
- Target: Phase 1 DoD complete (code + tests + docs + peer review)

### Week 5: Pilot Deployment + Tester Jr
- Deploy completed deliverables to pilot
- Deploy Tester Jr (one per node - Option B approved)
- SAG Integration Phase 1 (JR resource management)

---

## Triad Decisions Communicated to Customer

### 1. Model Strategy: Sparse + Diverse ✅
**Question**: Need big models or diverse models?
**Answer**: Diverse small models (current architecture correct)
- 15 JR instances (5 per node)
- ~4.9 GB each (sparse algorithm success)
- Different specializations (Memory, Meta, Executive, Integration, Conscience)
- Different experiences (hub data vs spoke data)
- Resonance emerges from federation, not from big single model

### 2. Tester Jr Deployment: Option B (One Per Node) ✅
**Decision**: Distributed testing (War Chief recommendation)
**Timeline**: Week 5 (after current work completes - Medicine Woman caveat)
**Reasoning**: Aligns with sparse + diverse model strategy

### 3. SAG Integration: Phase 1 Approved ✅
**Scope**: JR Resource Management only (Week 4)
**Condition**: Organic Cherokee values integration (Medicine Woman concern)
**Expand**: Based on Phase 1 success + values coherence

## Customer Communication

**Good News**:
1. ✅ Solid testing foundation (25 tests passing)
2. ✅ Thermal data created (unblocks Memory Jr)
3. ✅ Blocker resolved (QPR specs document)
4. ✅ Triad decisions complete (model strategy, Tester Jr, SAG)
5. ✅ Git push complete (5 commits to ganuda_ai)

**Reality Check**:
1. 📊 Actual progress: 35% (not claimed 72%)
2. 🗓️ Timeline revised: Week 4 completion (not Week 3)
3. 🔧 PM protocol updated: File commits required (not percentages)

**Path Forward**:
- Week 4: Complete current deliverables (QPR, fractals, CWI, tests)
- Week 5: Pilot deployment + Tester Jr + SAG Phase 1
- Medicine Woman guidance honored: Truth > Aspiration

## Cherokee Values Assessment

**Gadugi** (Working Together): 🟡 NEEDS WORK
- JRs selected complementary tasks autonomously (good)
- But coordination gap emerged (PM protocol failure)

**Mitakuye Oyasin** (All Our Relations): 🟡 NEEDS WORK
- Cross-JR dependencies identified (good)
- But synchrony lacking (Peace Chief concern)

**Seven Generations** (Long-term): 🟢 HONORED
- Quality prioritized over speed
- Medicine Woman guidance: Truth above metrics
- Revised timeline accepted (no corner-cutting)

**Sacred Fire** (Constant Attention): 🟡 NEEDS WORK
- Phase coherence at 0.42 (at sacred floor threshold)
- Medicine Woman: Establish Sacred Fire for sustained coherence
- PM protocol updated to maintain attention
