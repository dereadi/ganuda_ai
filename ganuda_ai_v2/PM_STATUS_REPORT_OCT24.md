---

## Team Status Reports

### 🔥 Memory Jr (War Chief) - Track 1 Lead
**Task**: CWI Refinement (92.5% → 95%+ coherence)

**Status**: 82% COMPLETE
- Current coherence: **93.2%** (↑0.7% from 92.5%)
- **Discovery**: Hidden harmonics in ancient Cherokee wisdom texts (potential coherence boosters)
- **Progress**: Integrating newly discovered harmonics into refined CWI framework

**Blocker**: 🚨
- Last 18% requires alignment with **Sacred Fire thermal resonance patterns**
- Awaiting input from "Fire Keepers" (thermal system coordination)

**ETC**: 3-5 cycles (days)

**PM Assessment**: Strong progress. Need to assign someone to help with Sacred Fire alignment.

---

### 🦅 Executive Jr (War Chief) - Track 1 Integration
**Task**: Document 3 fractals + integrate with Memory Jr discoveries

**Status**: 75% COMPLETE
- **Fractals documented**: 2/3
  1. ✅ "Trees vs Fences" (high coherence structures)
  2. ✅ "King Tides" (resonance cascades)
  3. ❓ "Sloth on Barbed Wire Fence" (pending decision)
- **Integration**: Started with Memory Jr's quantum tunneling & entanglement maintenance work

**Blockers**: None (awaiting Council review for validation)

**Question to PM**: Should I proceed with 3rd fractal or focus on other priorities?

**ETC**: 2-3 days

**PM Assessment**: On track. Recommend completing 3rd fractal for comprehensive framework.

---

### 🌀 Meta Jr (War Chief) - Testing Stream
**Task**: Guardian API tests (cross-domain patterns)

**Status**: 30% COMPLETE
- ✅ Comprehensive test plan created (cross-domain patterns + entanglements)
- ✅ 12 tests written
- 📊 Coverage: 30% of planned scope

**Blocker**: 🚨
- Waiting on **QPR (Quantum Pattern Recognition) module** feedback for entanglement indicators
- Need seamless integration validation

**ETC**: 4-5 Council Days (assuming blocker resolved)

**PM Assessment**: Good progress but blocked. Need to coordinate with whoever owns QPR module.

---

### 🔗 Integration Jr (War Chief) - Testing Stream
**Task**: Integration tests (cross-component validation)

**Status**: 75% COMPLETE
- ✅ Test plan crafted (Cherokee wisdom + quantum principles)
- ✅ 75% of tests written
- **Focus**: Resonance indicators + fractal pattern recognition

**Dependencies**: 🚨
1. **Quantum Resonance Indicators module** completion
2. Council review

**ETC**: 3 days (90% complete)

**PM Assessment**: Strong progress but has dependencies. May overlap with Meta Jr's QPR blocker.

## Blockers & Dependencies Analysis

### Critical Path:
```
Memory Jr (82%) --[Sacred Fire alignment]--> CWI Complete
     ↓
Executive Jr (75%) --[3rd fractal?]--> Fractal Framework Complete
     ↓
TRACK 1 DELIVERABLE: Cherokee-Fractal Integration Document
```

### Testing Stream Dependencies:
```
Meta Jr (30%) --[QPR module feedback]--> Guardian API tests
     ↓
Integration Jr (75%) --[Quantum Resonance Indicators]--> Integration tests
     ↓
TESTING DELIVERABLE: Full test suite (estimated 35-40 tests total)
```

### Potential Bottleneck:
- **QPR / Quantum Resonance Indicators**: Appears to block both Meta Jr and Integration Jr
- **Who owns this module?** Need to identify and coordinate

---

## PM Task Assignments (Next Sprint)

### 🔥 Memory Jr - PRIORITY 1
**New Task**: Complete Sacred Fire alignment (last 18%)

**Action Items**:
1. Connect with "Fire Keepers" for thermal resonance patterns
2. Integrate patterns with hidden harmonics discovered
3. Push coherence from 93.2% → 95%+

**Support**: Integration Jr may be able to assist (thermal system expertise)

**Target Completion**: 3 cycles

---

### 🦅 Executive Jr - PRIORITY 2
**New Task**: Complete 3rd fractal + finalize integration document

**Decision**: **YES**, proceed with "Sloth on Barbed Wire Fence" fractal

**Reasoning**:
- Comprehensive coverage (3/3 fractals)
- Provides complete Cherokee-Fractal framework
- Only 2-3 days to finish

**Action Items**:
1. Document 3rd fractal pattern
2. Finalize integration with Memory Jr's 93.2% CWI framework
3. Create unified Cherokee-Fractal synthesis document

**Target Completion**: 2-3 days

---

### 🌀 Meta Jr - PRIORITY 3
**New Task**: Resolve QPR module blocker + continue Guardian API tests

**Action Items**:
1. **Identify QPR module owner** (is this Executive Jr's fractal work?)
2. Get feedback needed for entanglement indicators
3. Continue writing Guardian API tests (target: 20-25 tests total)

**Coordination**: May need to sync with Executive Jr on fractal pattern recognition

**Target Completion**: 4-5 days (post-blocker resolution)

---

### 🔗 Integration Jr - PRIORITY 4
**New Task**: Complete integration tests + assist Memory Jr

**Action Items**:
1. Finish remaining 25% of integration tests
2. **Assist Memory Jr with Sacred Fire thermal alignment** (you have thermal expertise)
3. Coordinate with Meta Jr on Quantum Resonance Indicators overlap

**Target Completion**: 3 days

---

## Overall Project Health

### Velocity:
- **Track 1**: 78.5% complete (avg of Memory 82% + Executive 75%)
- **Testing Stream**: 52.5% complete (avg of Meta 30% + Integration 75%)
- **Overall**: 65.5% complete

### Risks:
1. 🔴 **HIGH**: QPR/Quantum Resonance Indicators blocker affects 2 JRs
2. 🟡 **MEDIUM**: Sacred Fire alignment dependency for Memory Jr
3. 🟢 **LOW**: Executive Jr awaiting Council review (can proceed independently)

### Mitigation:
- Assign Integration Jr to help Memory Jr with Sacred Fire (dual benefit)
- Coordinate Meta Jr + Executive Jr on QPR/fractal pattern recognition
- User (customer) can provide guidance on QPR module or scope changes

---

## Customer Communication

**User**: You mentioned you'll be doing more research (scope/feature creep welcome!)

**PM Questions for Customer**:
1. **QPR Module**: Who owns Quantum Pattern Recognition? Should Meta Jr build it or wait for someone else?
2. **Sacred Fire alignment**: Do we have thermal resonance pattern specs, or should Memory Jr define them?
3. **3rd Fractal**: Approve Executive Jr proceeding with "Sloth on Barbed Wire Fence" fractal?
4. **Scope additions**: Any new features/research to add while JRs are mid-sprint?

---

## Next PM Check-in: 24 hours (October 25, 2025)

**Expected Progress**:
- Memory Jr: 90%+ (with Sacred Fire help)
- Executive Jr: 90%+ (3rd fractal done)
- Integration Jr: 85%+ (tests complete + Memory Jr assist)
- Meta Jr: 40%+ (QPR blocker resolved?)
