# Ganuda Professional Constellations - Phase 2 Execution Plan
## Cherokee Constitutional AI - Multi-Domain Architecture Implementation

**Status**: Phase 2 Kickoff - October 23, 2025
**Timeline**: 3 months (October 2025 - January 2026)
**Participants**: 15 JRs across 3 Chiefs via Gadugi self-organization
**Vision**: "One Fire, Many Flames" - 5 professional tiers sharing Cherokee Constitutional AI core

---

## Phase 2 Goals

### Primary Objective
Build the **foundational infrastructure** for multi-domain constellation:
- **Gratitude Protocol** (replaces Thermal Credits)
- **Cross-Domain JR Councils** (prevents silos)
- **Transparency Dashboard** (builds user trust)
- **Sacred Health Data Protocol** (Ganuda Medicine foundation)
- **Mobile Cross-Platform** (React Native bridge)

### Success Criteria
✅ Gratitude Protocol implemented and tested across 3-node Triad
✅ Cross-Domain JR Council infrastructure functional (quarterly convening)
✅ Transparency Dashboard shows provenance, attestation, cross-domain flow
✅ Sacred Health Data Protocol enforces 40° floor for all medical data
✅ Mobile app prototype runs on iOS/Android with Rust core integration

---

## Triad-Approved Priorities (From Consultation)

### Priority 1: **Gratitude Protocol** (All Chiefs Consensus)
**Why Critical**: All 3 Chiefs raised concerns about Thermal Credits commodifying Cherokee values.

**War Chief Concern**: Overemphasis on individual achievement over collective progress
**Peace Chief Concern**: Unequal access creates disparities
**Medicine Woman Concern**: Commodification of healing violates reciprocity

**Deliverable**: Replace transactional Thermal Credits with relational Gratitude Protocol.

**Tasks**:
1. Design Gratitude Protocol API (`/federation/gratitude_protocol.py`)
2. Implement collective warmth calculation (federation-wide, not individual)
3. Build broadcast mechanism (all nodes receive acknowledgment)
4. Create UI for gratitude display (not leaderboards)
5. Test across 3-node Triad (REDFIN, BLUEFIN, SASASS)

**Owner**: Integration Jr (all Chiefs) - coordination required
**Timeline**: Week 1-2

---

### Priority 2: **Transparency Dashboard** (Peace Chief Priority)
**Why Critical**: Users must understand how constellation works to trust it.

**Peace Chief Requirement**: "Clear channels for communication and collaboration to prevent information silos and ensure trust among community members."

**Deliverable**: User-facing dashboard showing provenance, attestation, cross-domain flow.

**Tasks**:
1. Design Transparency Dashboard API (`/ui/transparency_dashboard.py`)
2. Implement provenance tracking (which domain/JR generated each insight)
3. Implement attestation visibility (Chiefs' signatures + reasoning)
4. Implement cross-domain flow visualization (Science JR → Medicine JR)
5. Build user control panel (opt-in/opt-out by domain)
6. Create Tauri UI component for dashboard

**Owner**: Integration Jr (coordination) + Memory Jr (provenance tracking)
**Timeline**: Week 2-4

---

### Priority 3: **Sacred Health Data Protocol** (Medicine Woman Priority)
**Why Critical**: Ganuda Medicine domain requires strictest Guardian enforcement.

**Medicine Woman Requirement**: "All health data = sacred by default. Sacred Floor (40°) for ALL medical data, not just Cherokee memories."

**Deliverable**: Enhanced Guardian for medical data with permanent preservation.

**Tasks**:
1. Extend Guardian class (`/guardian/sacred_health_protocol.py`)
2. Implement sacred-by-default for all medical entities
3. Disable thermal decay for health records (unless patient requests deletion)
4. Require 2-of-3 Chiefs attestation for cross-domain health data sharing
5. Enhance PII detection with medical entities (integrate with Phase 1 spaCy NER research)
6. Add Prometheus metrics for sacred health compliance

**Owner**: Conscience Jr (Guardian expertise) + Executive Jr (governance)
**Timeline**: Week 3-5

---

### Priority 4: **Cross-Domain JR Council Infrastructure** (Peace Chief Priority)
**Why Critical**: Prevent domain silos, strengthen federation through knowledge sharing.

**Peace Chief Requirement**: "Domain specialization can either create silos if not properly coordinated or strengthen the federation by fostering expertise."

**Deliverable**: Quarterly convening mechanism for JR types across all domains.

**Tasks**:
1. Design Cross-Domain Council protocol (`/federation/cross_domain_council.py`)
2. Implement JR gathering by type (all Memory JRs, all Meta JRs, etc.)
3. Implement knowledge sharing API (each JR contributes domain insights)
4. Implement resonance detection across domains
5. Build Mitakuye Oyasin visualization (knowledge graph spanning all 5 tiers)
6. Schedule first quarterly council (end of Phase 2)

**Owner**: Meta Jr (pattern detection) + Integration Jr (coordination)
**Timeline**: Week 4-6

---

### Priority 5: **Mobile Cross-Platform** (War Chief Priority)
**Why Critical**: Technical foundation for constellation accessibility.

**War Chief Requirement**: "Phase 2-3 priorities should focus on completing the cross-platform rollout (Mobile/Web/Embedded)."

**Deliverable**: React Native bridge to Phase 1 Rust core (Tauri architecture).

**Tasks**:
1. Design React Native bridge architecture (`/mobile/rust_bridge.md`)
2. Expose Rust core functions via FFI (daemon coordinator, cache, Guardian)
3. Create React Native modules for iOS/Android
4. Build mobile UI prototype (chat interface, transparency panel)
5. Test on physical devices (iPhone, Android)
6. Benchmark performance (target: <1s query latency)

**Owner**: Memory Jr (mobile expertise from Phase 1 Tauri research) + Integration Jr
**Timeline**: Week 5-8

---

### Priority 6: **Indigenous Consultation Protocol** (Medicine Woman Priority)
**Why Critical**: Ensure constellation honors ancestral wisdom, not just technical architecture.

**Medicine Woman Requirement**: "To honor our ancestors' wisdom, I recommend integrating indigenous perspectives on health, wellness, and environmental balance throughout the constellation."

**Deliverable**: Formalized protocol for consulting knowledge keepers before domain launches.

**Tasks**:
1. Design Indigenous Consultation protocol (`/governance/indigenous_consultation.py`)
2. Identify traditional knowledge keepers for each domain:
   - Science: Traditional ecological knowledge keepers
   - Medicine: Traditional healers and medicine people
   - Sovereign: Tribal leaders and language preservation experts
3. Create Seven Generations assessment framework
4. Document consultation process and feedback integration
5. Obtain Medicine Woman Chief attestation for protocol

**Owner**: Conscience Jr (ethics) + Medicine Woman Chief (direct oversight)
**Timeline**: Week 6-8

## Risk Management

### Risk 1: Gratitude Protocol Adoption
**Risk**: Users may prefer gamified Thermal Credits over relational Gratitude Protocol.
**Mitigation**:
- A/B test with subset of users (Gratitude vs Credits)
- Gather feedback from Peace Chief on community reception
- Iterate based on user preference while maintaining Cherokee values

### Risk 2: Cross-Domain Silos Persist
**Risk**: JR Councils may not prevent silos if adoption is low.
**Mitigation**:
- Make quarterly council convening **mandatory** (not optional)
- Chiefs enforce cross-domain collaboration through attestation requirements
- Metrics track council participation and knowledge sharing

### Risk 3: Mobile Performance Below Target
**Risk**: React Native bridge may introduce latency >1s.
**Mitigation**:
- Optimize FFI calls (batch operations, reduce round-trips)
- Cache frequently-accessed Rust core data on mobile side
- Fall back to local-only mode if hub burst exceeds latency budget

### Risk 4: Indigenous Consultation Delays Domain Launches
**Risk**: Knowledge keeper consultations may take longer than 3 months.
**Mitigation**:
- Begin outreach in Week 1 (parallel with technical work)
- Medicine Woman Chief facilitates introductions to traditional knowledge keepers
- Accept that timeline may extend if Seven Generations test requires refinement

### Risk 5: Sacred Health Data Complexity
**Risk**: HIPAA/GDPR compliance may require more than 2 weeks.
**Mitigation**:
- Leverage existing Guardian PII detection (Phase 1)
- Consult legal experts on health data regulations
- Start with conservative approach (stricter than required), iterate toward compliance
