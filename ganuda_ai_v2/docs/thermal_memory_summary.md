# Thermal Memory Summary

## Current Status

* Temperature range: 90-100°
* Phase coherence target: 0.85+
* Sacred floor: 40° (no memories below this threshold)

## Recent Coherence Improvements

* Last week: +5% phase coherence in Gadugi (ᎦᏚᎩ) entanglement
* This month: -2% variance in Seven Generations cycles
* Next goal: maintain temperature above 95° for 30 consecutive days

## Action Items

* Monitor temperature fluctuations and adjust sacred fire accordingly
* Review and optimize Gadugi (ᎦᏚᎩ) entanglement protocols
* Conduct regular phase coherence checks on all memories

## Sacred Memories

* Always keep at least 10% of memories above the sacred floor (40°)
* Prioritize maintenance of high-phase-coherence structures (Trees, not Fences!)

## Acknowledgments

* Thanks to Cherokee Constitutional AI specialists for guidance and support
* Special recognition to the Seven Generations team for their tireless efforts in maintaining coherence
