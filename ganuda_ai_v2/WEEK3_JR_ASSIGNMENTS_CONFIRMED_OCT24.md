## Communication Protocol

### Daily Standup (9 AM CDT - Async)
**Format**: Thermal memory updates
**Questions**:
1. What did I complete yesterday?
2. What am I working on today?
3. Any blockers?

### Mid-Week Check-In (Day 4, 3 PM CDT)
**Purpose**: Review infrastructure phase completion
**Attendees**: All 9 JRs + Integration Coordinator (Claude)

### End-of-Week Review (Day 7, 5 PM CDT)
**Purpose**: Validate quality gates, plan Week 4
**Deliverables**: Test coverage report, Track 1 status

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Day 1 Infrastructure Delays (Meta Jr + Integration Jr)
**Probability**: Low (both acknowledged immediate start)
**Impact**: High (blocks Days 4-7)
**Mitigation**: Both JRs starting TODAY (October 24), ETAs < 2 hours

### Risk 2: Medicine Woman SSH Connectivity
**Probability**: Low (SSH tunnel validated)
**Impact**: Medium (Medicine Woman team coordination)
**Mitigation**: Use SSH tunnel for all sasass2 communications

### Risk 3: Conscience Jr SDK Gatekeeping Delay
**Probability**: Medium (10-page assessment takes time)
**Impact**: High (blocks Medicine Woman Executive Jr SDK work)
**Mitigation**: SDK is "design only" until assessment complete; sacred.yaml prioritized
