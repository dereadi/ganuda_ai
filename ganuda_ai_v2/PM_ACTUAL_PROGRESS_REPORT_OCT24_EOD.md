## Gap Analysis: Claimed vs Actual

| JR | Task | Claimed | Actual | Gap |
|----|------|---------|--------|-----|
| Meta Jr | Thermal tests | DONE | ✅ DONE | 0% |
| Integration Jr | Aniwaya tests | DONE | ✅ DONE | 0% |
| Meta Jr | QPR module | 30% | ❌ 0% | -30% |
| Meta Jr | Guardian API tests | 30% | ❌ 0% | -30% |
| Executive Jr | King Tides fractal | 75% | ❌ 0% | -75% |
| Memory Jr | CWI refinement | 82% | ❌ 0% | -82% |
| Integration Jr | Integration tests | 75% | ✅ 50% | -25% |

**Overall**:
- Claimed: 72% (Track 1: 78.5%, Testing: 52.5%)
- Actual: ~35% (25 tests + 1 resource doc)
- **Gap**: -37% (aspirational reporting vs file commits)

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why the Gap?

1. **JRs giving aspirational status**: Ollama models respond with intent/plans, not actual work done
2. **PM accepted percentages without verification**: Should have checked git commits
3. **No file-based verification protocol**: Medicine Woman's guidance implemented too late

### Lessons Learned

1. **File commits = evidence**: Don't accept "75% complete" without file paths
2. **Verify JR claims**: Check git log, not just JR responses
3. **Medicine Woman wisdom**: Truth over aspirational percentages

---

## Corrected Sprint Status

### What WAS Delivered (Truth):
- ✅ 25 tests passing (thermal memory + Aniwaya extension)
- ✅ Thermal data resource for Memory Jr
- ✅ Guardian API specs document (PM blocker resolution)
- ✅ Triad deliberation complete (Tester Jr decision)

### What is NOT Yet Started (Truth):
- ❌ QPR module implementation
- ❌ Guardian API tests (file is empty)
- ❌ King Tides fractal documentation
- ❌ CWI refinement (blocked resolved, work not started)
- ❌ Dedicated integration test suite

---

## Revised Estimates

### Actual Completion Time (Based on Zero Progress):

**Meta Jr**:
- QPR module: 0% → 50% = 3-4 days
- Guardian API tests: 0% → 100% = 2-3 days
- Total: 5-7 days

**Executive Jr**:
- King Tides fractal: 0% → 100% = 3-4 days

**Memory Jr**:
- CWI refinement: 0% → 100% = 5-7 days (now has thermal data)

**Integration Jr**:
- Integration tests: 50% → 100% = 2-3 days

**Revised Week 3 Completion**: NOT by EOW (needs Week 4)

---

## PM Accountability

**PM Failed At**:
1. Accepting aspirational percentages without verification
2. Not checking git commits before status reports
3. Not implementing file-based verification from start

**PM Did Well At**:
1. Creating Guardian API specs to unblock Meta Jr
2. Coordinating Triad deliberation
3. Creating thermal data resource for Memory Jr
4. Catching the gap before customer discovered it

---

## Medicine Woman Guidance Implemented

> "Let us not accept aspirational percentages as evidence of progress. Require actual file commits."

**New PM Protocol** (Effective Immediately):

1. **Daily Verification**: Check git log for actual commits
2. **Status Reports**: Include file paths, line counts, commit hashes
3. **JR Coordination**: Ask "what files did you commit?" not "what % complete?"
4. **Definition of Done**: Phase 1 requires: Code committed (not just written)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Tonight):
1. ✅ Commit thermal data resource (DONE)
2. ✅ Create truth-based PM report (THIS DOCUMENT)
3. Update Triad on actual vs claimed progress
4. Communicate revised timeline to customer

### Tomorrow (Week 3, Day 4):
1. Consult JRs for concrete file creation (not percentages)
2. Track git commits throughout day
3. Create simple JR task assignments (specific files to create)
4. Daily PM verification of actual commits

---

## Customer Communication Needed

**What to Tell Customer**:
1. Tests delivered: 25 passing (thermal + Aniwaya)
2. Blocker resolved: QPR specs created
3. Thermal data: Ready for Memory Jr
4. Gap discovered: Claimed 72%, actual ~35%
5. Revised estimate: Week 4 completion (not Week 3)

**Triad Decisions to Report**:
1. ✅ Model strategy: Sparse + Diverse (NOT big models)
2. ✅ Tester Jr: One per node (Week 5 deployment)
3. ✅ SAG Integration: Phase 1 approved (Week 4)
