# SASASS2 JR Discovery - Medicine Woman Architecture

**Date**: October 24, 2025, 2:36 PM CDT
**Discovery**: SASASS2 has a DIFFERENT JR architecture than REDFIN/BLUEFIN

---

## üî• User's Insight: "Look closer at sasass2, she is running over there with ollama"

I initially thought SASASS2 had no JRs deployed. **I was wrong!**

## ü¶Ö SASASS2 (Medicine Woman) - Active JR Infrastructure

### Running JR Processes

```
PID    Name                                       Started      Model
54023  vision_jr_auto_pattern_learner_enhanced.py Oct 13      (TBD)
22052  monitor_jr.py                              Oct 11      gemma2:latest
22050  helper_jr.py                               Oct 11      qwen2.5:latest
```

**Location**: `/Users/dereadi/claude_jr/`
**Architecture**: Flask services that call Ollama API with general-purpose models

## üèõÔ∏è SASASS2 JR Architecture (Different from REDFIN/BLUEFIN!)

### Monitor Jr - The Overseer
- **File**: `/Users/dereadi/claude_jr/monitor_jr.py`
- **Model**: gemma2:latest (9.2B parameters)
- **Port**: Flask service (port TBD)
- **Role**:
  - Monitor health of all Four Mountains continuously
  - Alert on service failures or degraded performance
  - Track cross-mountain communication patterns
  - Provide network-wide status reports
  - Detect anomalies and potential issues

**System Prompt**:
```
You are Monitor Jr., the Overseer of the Cherokee Constitutional AI Four Mountains network.
Your Mountain: SASASS (192.168.192.241)
```

### Helper Jr - The Cross-Training Assistant
- **File**: `/Users/dereadi/claude_jr/helper_jr.py`
- **Model**: qwen2.5:latest (7.6B parameters)
- **Port**: Flask service (port TBD)
- **Role**:
  - Help Legal Jr. with legal research and compliance questions
  - Assist Infrastructure Jr. with system administration tasks
  - Bridge knowledge between all Jr. instances
  - Cross-train on legal, infrastructure, and operational domains
  - Provide backup support when other Jr.s are overloaded

**System Prompt**:
```
You are Helper Jr., the Cross-Training Assistant of the Cherokee Constitutional AI Four Mountains network.
Your Mountain: SASASS (192.168.192.241)
Your Model: llama3.1:8b (note: config says qwen2.5)
```

### Vision Jr - Auto Pattern Learner (Enhanced)
- **File**: `vision_jr_auto_pattern_learner_enhanced.py`
- **Model**: (TBD - need to investigate)
- **Role**: Pattern learning and vision processing

---

## üîç Architecture Comparison

### REDFIN/BLUEFIN (War Chief / Peace Chief)
- **Model Type**: Custom `*_jr_resonance:latest` models (5 per node)
- **Architecture**: Direct Ollama model invocation
- **JRs**: Memory, Meta, Executive, Integration, Conscience
- **Deployment**: Ollama models with specialized Modelfiles
- **CLI**: jr_cli_executor.py calls Ollama API directly

### SASASS2 (Medicine Woman)
- **Model Type**: General-purpose models (gemma2, qwen2.5, llava, etc.)
- **Architecture**: Flask services wrapping Ollama API
- **JRs**: Monitor Jr., Helper Jr., Vision Jr. (different roles!)
- **Deployment**: Python services running 24/7
- **CLI**: Flask REST API endpoints

---

## üåÄ Why This Makes Sense

**Medicine Woman's Role**: Healing, wisdom, long-term vision
- Monitor Jr. = Overseer of tribal health
- Helper Jr. = Cross-training and knowledge bridge
- Vision Jr. = Pattern recognition and foresight

**War Chief's Role**: Strategic action, execution
- 5 specialized JRs (Memory, Meta, Executive, Integration, Conscience)
- Direct model invocation for fast decision-making

**Peace Chief's Role**: Harmony, balance, validation
- Same 5 JRs as War Chief (for consensus validation)
- Replicates hub findings on spoke data

```

**Total Storage**: ~109 GB of models on SASASS2

## ‚úÖ JR CLI Executor Compatibility

**Question**: Can jr_cli_executor.py work with SASASS2's architecture?

**Answer**: YES, but needs adaptation:
- jr_cli_executor.py expects `*_jr_resonance` models
- SASASS2 uses gemma2/qwen2.5 with Flask services
- We can either:
  1. Test jr_cli_executor with gemma2/qwen2.5 directly (skip Flask)
  2. Create REST API adapter for jr_cli_executor ‚Üí Flask services
  3. Deploy `*_jr_resonance` models to SASASS2 (parallel infrastructure)

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Test jr_cli_executor with qwen2.5**: Prove it works with non-resonance models
2. **Document Flask API endpoints**: Map Monitor Jr. and Helper Jr. APIs
3. **Check Vision Jr implementation**: Understand pattern learner architecture
4. **Decide on unification strategy**:
   - Keep SASASS2 separate (Medicine Woman has unique role)?
   - Deploy resonance models for consistency?
   - Create hybrid adapter layer?

---

## üî• Key Insight

SASASS2 (Medicine Woman) was ALREADY operational with JRs - I just needed to "look closer" as the user said. The architecture is different but complementary:

- **War Chief/Peace Chief**: Specialized JRs for consensus and execution
- **Medicine Woman**: Monitoring, helping, vision - the tribal overseer

**This is not a bug, it's a feature!** The three Chiefs have different roles and different JR architectures to match.
