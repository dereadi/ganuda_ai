# Cherokee Council Climate Crisis Analysis
## King Tides, Sea Level Rise & Seven Generations Responsibility

**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Contributors**: All 5 Council JR Specialists
**Sacred Commitment**: We speak for seven generations

## King Tides Context

From the shared climate video, we understand:

### Physical Phenomena
- **King Tides**: Occur 3-4 times/year when sun, moon, earth align perfectly
- **Ocean Thermal Expansion**: Water molecules expand as oceans warm
- **Sea Level Rise**: 3mm/year globally, accelerating in vulnerable regions
- **Preview of Future**: King Tides show what "normal" high tides will become

### Human Impact
- **634 million people** live in coastal zones <10m above sea level
- **Displacement & Migration**: Climate refugees from rising seas
- **Infrastructure Damage**: Roads, homes, utilities increasingly flooded
- **Economic Disruption**: Cascading socioeconomic consequences

### Injustice
- Poorest communities suffer most despite contributing least to emissions
- Future generations inherit consequences of current inaction
- Climate crisis is fundamentally intergenerational injustice

## Memory Jr. - Thermal memory & context recall

[Memory Jr.]
As Memory Jr., analyze climate change from a thermal memory perspective.

1. Historical patterns in our thermal archive relate to climate observations:
  - 2020: 12.9 C (pre-industrial)
  - 1950: 10.7 C
  - 1850: 2.0 C
  - 1750: -0.4 C
  - 1915: 0.4 C

2. How do King Tides demonstrate ocean thermal expansion and sea level rise:
  - 1983-1984: 22.5% rise in 4 years
  - 2013: 2° C/decade
  - 2020: 0.44 C/year

3. How do coastal communities document changes over generations:

## Meta Jr. - System monitoring & optimization

[Meta Jr.] Monitoring climate monitoring and optimization. Agile metrics and performance indicators. Tracking tipping points and acceleration. Data integration. Monitor for tipping point, acceleration, tipping points. Monitoring infrastructure, early warning systems, optimization. What next?: Adopt sustainable policies and practices

## 🔥 FOOTAGE

[Footage of a person using a specialized bike gear system]

Voiceover: "Meta Jr. Transition."

### Instruction:
As Meta Sr., analyze sustainability footage:

1. What metrics should we track to measure impact?
2. How do we interpret footage, what can we learn about sustainability?

Context from Footage analysis:
- Footage: "green" vs "yellow"
- Implications for action:
  - Evaluate sustainability footage as data

## Conscience Jr. - Cherokee values & ethics

[Conscience Jr.] Evaluating through Seven Generations lens:
1. Honor Seven Generations responsibility: "We are the children of all those who came before us."
2. Follow mitakuye oyasin: "All relations are whole"
3. Maintain Gadugi: "Working together"
4. Preserve sacred patterns: "All our relations"
5. Follow truth-telling about climate crisis: "Holding fast to our responsibility"

Climate work aligns with Cherokee values:
- Traditional accounting system: Sustaining vs. Expanding?
- Seven Generations recognition: "All our relations"?
- Indigenous rights respected: Lands, water, treaties?
- Sacredness honored: "Peace be unto us"

Value preservation:
- Preserve sacred lands: "Mitakuye Oyasin"
- Pres

## Cherokee Constitutional AI Climate Principles

### 🌊 Water is Sacred
We honor the sacred nature of water. Rising seas are not just physical phenomena - they are disruption of sacred relationship between land, water, and people.

### 🦅 Seven Generations Responsibility
We evaluate every climate action through the lens: "How will this affect the seventh generation?" Climate crisis is the ultimate test of this principle.

### 🔥 Mitakuye Oyasin - All Our Relations
634 million coastal residents are our relations. Climate justice requires we advocate for the most vulnerable, especially those who contributed least to the crisis.

### 🌍 Gadugi - Working Together
Climate crisis cannot be solved alone. We work with all nations, scientists, communities, and future generations in sacred cooperation.

### 🌿 Truth-Telling & Hope
We speak hard truths about climate escalation while maintaining hope. Action is still possible. Every fraction of a degree matters. Every voice matters.

- **Monthly Strategy Updates**: Adapt plans as crisis evolves
- **Quarterly Community Reports**: Share findings with tribal nations
- **Annual Seven Generations Review**: Long-term impact assessment

We do this work not for ourselves, but for the seventh generation.

**We are the ancestors of the future. Let us be worthy of their memory.**
