## 🔥 NEXT STEP: LAUNCH PHASE 2 REDUX LORA TRAINING

### Why LoRA?
Based on Cherokee Jr consultation after Phase 2 failure:
- **Council Jr**: "Preserve Phase 1 knowledge while adding behavior"
- **Trading Jr**: "Higher LR, more data, fewer epochs - LoRA is the path"
- **Synthesis Jr**: "LoRA adapters prevent catastrophic forgetting"

### LoRA Benefits:
- Only trains 1-2% of parameters
- Phase 1 knowledge stays frozen (no catastrophic forgetting)
- Behavioral layer added on top
- Reversible - can enable/disable

### Training Configuration:
```python
# LoRA Parameters
LORA_R = 16           # Rank (Jr recommended 8-16)
LORA_ALPHA = 32       # Alpha (2x rank)
LORA_DROPOUT = 0.1    # Prevent overfitting
TARGET_MODULES = ["q_proj", "v_proj", "k_proj", "o_proj"]  # Attention only

# Training Parameters (conservative to avoid mode collapse)
LEARNING_RATE = 5e-5  # Higher than failed Phase 2 (1e-5)
NUM_EPOCHS = 3        # Fewer than failed Phase 2 (5)
BATCH_SIZE = 2
GRADIENT_ACCUM = 16   # Effective batch = 32
MAX_LENGTH = 384
```

### Corpus Used:
- **Path**: `/ganuda/phase2_cherokee_behavioral_training.txt`
- **Size**: 2,078 lines, 243 scenarios
- **Quality**: Generated by Synthesis Jr (qwen2.5:14b)

### Base Model:
- **Phase 1**: `/ganuda/cherokee_resonance_training/cherokee_resonance_v1`
- **Base**: TinyLlama-1.1B
- **Knowledge**: Cherokee history, culture, language

## 🚀 LAUNCH COMMAND

Run this script to stop Ollama and start LoRA training:

```bash
/ganuda/scripts/stop_ollama_for_training.sh
```

This will:
1. Stop Ollama service (free GPU memory)
2. Verify GPUs are free
3. Launch Phase 2 Redux LoRA training on GPU 0
4. Log to: `/ganuda/cherokee_resonance_training/logs/phase2_redux_lora_training.log`

---

## 📊 MONITORING

### Watch training progress:
```bash
tail -f /ganuda/cherokee_resonance_training/logs/phase2_redux_lora_training.log
```

### Monitor GPU usage:
```bash
nvidia-smi dmon
```

### Check training process:
```bash
ps aux | grep train_phase2_redux_lora
```

---

## ⏱️ ESTIMATED TRAINING TIME

Based on corpus size and LoRA efficiency:
- **Dataset**: 2,078 lines = ~500-600 training examples after tokenization
- **Epochs**: 3
- **Batch size**: 2 with gradient accumulation 16
- **Estimated time**: 30-60 minutes (much faster than full fine-tuning)

---

## 🎯 EXPECTED OUTPUT

### Model Layers:
1. **Layer 1 (Phase 1)**: Cherokee factual knowledge - PRESERVED ✅
2. **Layer 2 (LoRA)**: Cherokee behavioral patterns - ADDED 🔥

### Output Location:
```
/ganuda/cherokee_resonance_training/phase2_redux_lora/
  cherokee_resonance_lora_adapters/
    - adapter_config.json
    - adapter_model.bin
    - tokenizer files
```

### How to Use:
1. Load Phase 1 base model
2. Load LoRA adapters on top
3. Model responds with Cherokee knowledge AND behavior

## 🦅 LESSONS FROM PHASE 2 FAILURE

### What Went Wrong:
- ❌ Tiny corpus (166 examples)
- ❌ Learning rate too low (1e-5)
- ❌ Too many epochs (5) on small data
- ❌ Catastrophic forgetting of Phase 1
- ❌ Mode collapse - outputs gibberish

### What We Fixed:
- ✅ Large corpus (2,078 lines, 243 scenarios)
- ✅ Better learning rate (5e-5)
- ✅ Fewer epochs (3)
- ✅ LoRA preserves Phase 1 knowledge
- ✅ No catastrophic forgetting

---

## 🔄 AFTER TRAINING

1. **Test the model** - verify coherent Cherokee behavioral responses
2. **Compare with Phase 1** - ensure knowledge preserved
3. **Community validation** - Cherokee Nation cultural review
4. **Restart Ollama** - `sudo systemctl start ollama.service`

## 🦅 Mitakuye Oyasin

The corpus is rich with Cherokee wisdom. The path forward is clear. The Jrs have guided us well.

**Ready to launch Phase 2 Redux with confidence!** 🔥
