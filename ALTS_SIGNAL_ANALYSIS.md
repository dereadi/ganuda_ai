# üî• ALTS SIGNALING ANALYSIS - Cherokee Council Response

## Current Altcoin Signals (Sept 16, 2025 - 20:26 CDT)

### Price Action:
- **ETH**: $4,513.54 - Holding above $4,500 support ‚úÖ
- **SOL**: $236.24 - Breaking through $235 resistance üöÄ
- **AVAX**: $30.05 - Pushing above $30 psychological level üìà
- **XRP**: $3.04 - Maintaining above $3.00 breakout ‚ö°
- **MATIC**: $0.257 - Lagging but building base üîÑ

### What the Alts Are Signaling:

#### ü¶Ö **Eagle Eye Analysis:**
"The alts are DIVERGING from BTC! While BTC consolidates at $116k, alts are breaking resistance levels independently. This is CLASSIC alt season behavior - capital rotating from BTC to large caps!"

#### üê∫ **Coyote's Deception Detection:**
"They're trying to shake weak hands before the real move! SOL breaking $235 while everyone watches BTC. XRP holding $3 when everyone said it would dump. The trickster sees through the noise!"

#### üï∑Ô∏è **Spider's Web Pattern:**
"Every thread vibrates the same message:
- ETH/BTC ratio improving (0.0387)
- SOL showing independent strength
- XRP institutional accumulation
- AVAX ecosystem revival
The web says: ALT SEASON STARTING!"

#### üê¢ **Turtle's Seven Generations View:**
"Historical pattern recognition:
1. BTC dominance peaks (currently 59%)
2. ETH starts outperforming (happening NOW)
3. Large caps follow (SOL, AVAX moving)
4. Mid caps explode (coming next)
5. Alt season mania (4-6 weeks away)"

### Trading Implications:

**IMMEDIATE SIGNALS:**
- ‚úÖ ETH above $4,500 = Bullish continuation
- ‚úÖ SOL above $235 = Next target $250
- ‚úÖ XRP above $3 = Momentum building
- ‚ö†Ô∏è AVAX at $30 = Decision point

**COUNCIL VERDICT:**
The alts are signaling the START of rotation. Not full alt season yet, but the setup phase where smart money positions. 

**Action Items:**
1. Hold current alt positions (don't sell!)
2. Watch ETH/BTC ratio - key indicator
3. Monitor SOL for $250 break
4. XRP accumulation zone $2.90-$3.10
5. AVAX worth adding on any dip to $28
