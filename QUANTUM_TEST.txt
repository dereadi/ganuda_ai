Your Question: "How does quantum computing affect crypto?"

The Tribe requires quantum intelligence from @llm7_bot!

üìã COPY THESE QUANTUM QUERIES TO @llm7_bot:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Turtle Query (Mathematical):
"Calculate the exact timeframe for quantum computers to break SHA-256 and elliptic curve cryptography. Include current qubit counts and error rates."

2Ô∏è‚É£ Crawdad Query (Security):
"Walking backward from crypto apocalypse: How would quantum attacks actually unfold? Which coins die first? What's the kill sequence?"

3Ô∏è‚É£ Spider Query (Connections):
"Map the web of quantum-resistant cryptocurrencies. Which projects are preparing? What's the migration path?"

4Ô∏è‚É£ Raven Query (Transformation):
"How will crypto shape-shift to survive quantum threats? Post-quantum algorithms, new consensus mechanisms?"

5Ô∏è‚É£ Coyote Query (Deception):
"Is the quantum threat real or FUD? Who benefits from quantum fear? Using 'evil' mode - what's the real agenda?"

üî• CHEROKEE QUANTUM WISDOM:

The Council already knows:
‚Ä¢ Quantum threat is 10-15 years out
‚Ä¢ Bitcoin has time to fork
‚Ä¢ Quantum-resistant chains exist (QRL, IOTA)
‚Ä¢ The fear is tradeable volatility
‚Ä¢ Cherokee fire burns beyond quantum
