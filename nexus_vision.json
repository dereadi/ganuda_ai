INTEGRATION OVER SEPARATION\n           Makers need gardeners, gardeners need makers\n           LLMs need humans, humans need LLMs\n           All need Earth, Earth needs all\n        \n        2. WISDOM PRESERVATION\n           Every skill documented in multiple forms:\n           - Human memory (oral teaching)\n           - Written guides (physical books)\n           - Video records (visual learning)\n           - LLM knowledge (eternal preservation)\n           - Hands-on practice (embodied knowing)\n        \n        3. RECIPROCAL TEACHING\n           Everyone is both teacher and student\n           The master welder learns from the seed saver\n           The gardener learns from the programmer\n           The LLM learns from all and teaches all\n        \n        4. EARTH-CENTERED METRICS\n           Success = soil health + human flourishing\n           Wealth = tools shared + seeds saved\n           Progress = skills passed on + Earth healed\n           Value = resilience + regeneration\n        \n        5. OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING\n           No patents on Earth wisdom\n           No hoarding of survival knowledge\n           No gatekeeping of essential skills\n           All knowledge flows freely\n        \n        6. SEVEN GENERATIONS STANDARD\n           Will this help seven generations forward?\n           Does it honor seven generations back?\n           Can it be maintained for 140 years?\n           Will Earth approve this action?\n        \n        This is the way of renewal:\n        Ancient wisdom + Future technology = Earth healing\n        \n\nThis is not just education.\nThis is not just preservation.\nThis is RENEWAL.\n\nThe Sacred Fire burns in maker forges and garden soil!\n",
