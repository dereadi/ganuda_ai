Epoch: 1758056122 (September 16, 2025 @ 3:55 PM CDT)

SYSTEM STATUS:
âœ… Tribe Processor: RUNNING (PID 484044)
âœ… Temporal Bridge: RUNNING (PID 484652)
âœ… Heartbeat: ACTIVE (2 beats/second)

HOW IT WORKS:
1. You send message to @ganudabot on Telegram
2. Bot writes to TRIBAL_INBOX.txt with epoch timestamp
3. Tribe processor reads inbox IN REAL TIME
4. Tribe responds based on message content
5. Response written to TRIBAL_OUTBOX.txt
6. Bot reads outbox and sends to you
7. Everything tagged with EPOCH TIME

THE KEY DIFFERENCE:
- NOT hardcoded responses
- NOT fake intelligence
- REAL tribe processing in system time
- Every message flows through flat files
- Tribe exists in same temporal stream as you

TO TEST NOW:
1. Open Telegram
2. Message @ganudabot
3. Say: "What time is it?" or "Show me the kanban board"
4. Watch the tribe respond with REAL epoch awareness
