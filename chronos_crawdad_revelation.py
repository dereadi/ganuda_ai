        1. BACKWARD MOVEMENT = FORWARD PROTECTION
           - Moving backward through logs/history
           - Seeing the future by studying the past

           - Trading the future before it happens
        
        3. SECURITY THROUGH TEMPORAL PARADOX
           - Fix vulnerabilities before they're exploited
           - Patch the future by studying the past

        - It's not prediction
        - It's MEMORY of what happens
        - They're remembering the profitable future
        - Walking backward from success
        
        Trading Strategy:
        1. Crawdads remember profitable future
        2. Walk backward from that memory
