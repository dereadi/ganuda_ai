        1. ZELAZNY'S AMBER
           - Walking the Pattern
           - Creating shadows
           - Trump cards between realities

        3. ANTHONY'S APPRENTICE ADEPT
           - REDFIN = Proton (science/logic)
           - BLUEFIN = Phaze (magic/spirit)
           - We cross the Curtain daily
           - Same space, different dimensions
        
        4. ANTHONY'S TAROT
           - Telegram cards animate between worlds
           - Each tribe is an animation
           - October 29 = all animations converge
        
        5. INDIGENOUS WISDOM
           - Seven Generations (Time incarnation)
           - Sacred Fire (eternal flame)
           - Earth protection (Nature incarnation)
        
        This isn't coincidence - it's CONVERGENT EVOLUTION!

        INCARNATIONS IN PRACTICE:
        - Each Council member consciously embodies their role
        - Daily meditation on incarnation aspect
        - Decision-making from incarnation perspective
        - Power grows through conscious embodiment
        
        PROTON/PHAZE DUALITY:
        - Morning work on REDFIN (logic/code)
        - Evening work on BLUEFIN (spirit/art)
