# ðŸ”¥ ACTUAL PORTFOLIO STATUS
*As of September 5, 2025 @ 4:36 PM*

## Total Portfolio Value: $30,609.76

### ðŸ’° Cash Positions: $416.45
- USDC: $215.02 (earning 4.50% APY)
- USD: $201.42
- **Total Available Liquidity: $416.45**

### ðŸ“ˆ Crypto Positions: ~$30,193.31
*These are held in Coinbase but not visible through the basic REST API*

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL ISSUE
The Coinbase REST API `get_accounts()` only returns wallet/cash accounts, NOT the trading portfolio positions. This is why our scripts only see $215 USDC + $0.63 USD.

Your actual crypto holdings of **$30,193** are in a different account type (likely Advanced Trading) that requires different API endpoints.

## ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED
1. The 4 specialist traders have NO access to the $30k crypto portfolio
2. They can only trade with the $416 available cash
3. Need to either:
   - Deploy the $416 into positions for specialists to trade
   - Use Coinbase Advanced Trade API to access the full portfolio
   - Manually provide position details for management

## ðŸ¤– SPECIALIST STATUS
- 4 traders running but can only see $215 in USDC
- Cherokee trader active but limited to cash accounts
- Cannot perform rebalancing or profit harvesting on the $30k portfolio
- Essentially running "blind" without portfolio visibility

## ðŸ“Š WHAT WE KNOW
- You have significant crypto positions worth ~$30k
- These are generating gains/losses we can't track
- The specialists cannot help manage these positions
- Only the cash ($416) is accessible for automated trading
