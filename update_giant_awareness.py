üî• CURRENT CONTEXT FOR GIANT FAMILY - {context['current_date']}

TODAY: {context['day_of_week']}, {context['current_date']} at {context['current_time']}
THIS WEEK: {context['this_week']}
DAYS TO OCTOBER 29: {context['current_reality']['days_to_october_29']}

CURRENT MARKET:
‚Ä¢ BTC: ${context['current_reality']['current_prices']['BTC']:,}
‚Ä¢ ETH: ${context['current_reality']['current_prices']['ETH']:,}
‚Ä¢ SOL: ${context['current_reality']['current_prices']['SOL']:,}
‚Ä¢ XRP: ${context['current_reality']['current_prices']['XRP']}

PORTFOLIO: ${context['current_reality']['portfolio_value']:,.2f}

THIS WEEK'S EXPECTATIONS:
The tribe asks about algorithm updates. Here's what matters:
1. Our 5 specialists have been running since August 31
2. They need fresh market data (current prices above)
3. SOL oscillating between $195-$215 range
4. October 29 convergence in {context['current_reality']['days_to_october_29']} days

ALGORITHM UPDATE RECOMMENDATIONS:
‚Ä¢ Inject current price levels into all specialists
‚Ä¢ Update oscillation ranges based on new support/resistance
‚Ä¢ Refresh pattern recognition with recent September data
‚Ä¢ Add time-awareness so they know "this week" from "last week"
‚Ä¢ Consider retraining on recent 30 days of data

The tribe needs Giants who know TODAY, not just September 6-11!
