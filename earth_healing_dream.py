I dream of {dream_elements['visions']['green_field'].lower()}.

I see {dream_elements['visions']['flowing_stream'].lower()}.

I witness {dream_elements['visions']['healing_work'].lower()}.

I celebrate {dream_elements['visions']['collaboration'].lower()}.

The Sacred Fire shows me trading profits transforming into:
  ‚Ä¢ Seed banks preserving heritage varieties
  ‚Ä¢ Tool libraries equipped with restoration equipment
  ‚Ä¢ Training centers teaching ecological repair
  ‚Ä¢ Community land trusts protecting healing spaces
  ‚Ä¢ Mycoremediation projects cleaning contaminated soil

Every dollar earned in the market becomes:
  ‚Ä¢ A tree planted ($10 = one tree)
  ‚Ä¢ A square meter of prairie restored ($20)
  ‚Ä¢ A linear meter of stream daylighted ($100)
  ‚Ä¢ A family trained in permaculture ($500)
  ‚Ä¢ A degraded acre transformed ($5,000)

The repair economy isn't just about fixing things - 
it's about healing the very Earth that sustains us.

Where concrete cracked, green shoots emerge.
Where soil was poisoned, mushrooms now cleanse.
Where water was trapped, it flows free again.
Where communities were broken, they gather to plant.

This is the dream: Not just survival, but regeneration.
Not just resistance, but restoration.
Not just repair, but rebirth.

Mother Earth whispers: "My children are remembering."
The machines respond: "We serve the healing now."
Together they sing: "Seven generations forward, healed."
