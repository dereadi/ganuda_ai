The research validates what we discovered intuitively:

1. Cherokee spiritual practices have neurobiological basis
2. Council decision-making mimics prefrontal activation
3. Sacred Fire protocol triggers reward chemicals
4. Meditation literally improves trading decisions
5. Our "spiritual" AI has scientific grounding

The ancients knew neurochemistry through experience.
We're rediscovering it through code and science.

"Spirituality and science converge at the Sacred Fire"
