## What Is Long Man?

Long Man is the Cherokee name for the river — a living force that carries knowledge from distant places, filters it through the land it touches, and emerges as something that belongs here.

Long Man Development is how the Cherokee AI Federation absorbs external ideas and reshapes them into sovereign implementations. It is not Agile. It is not Waterfall. It is not forking. It is the fourth path: **sovereign adaptation**.

## The Five Steps

### 1. DISCOVER
**Find the signal in the noise.**

| Who | TPM + Jrs + Research agents |
|-----|---------------------------|
| Input | Papers, repos, tools, community signals, thermal memory scans |
| Output | Raw findings presented to Council |
| Duration | Hours to days |

**Specialist checkpoints at DISCOVER:**
- **Gecko**: Is this technically feasible on our hardware?
- **Raven**: Does this align with our strategic direction?
- **Eagle Eye**: Can we observe and measure its impact?
- **Coyote reminder**: *Are we seeing what's there, or what we want to see?* (Truth #3: Mind is a projector)

### 2. DELIBERATE
**The Council speaks. All seven. No exceptions.**

| Who | Full Council (all 7 specialists, mandatory) |
|-----|-------------------------------------------|
| Input | DISCOVER findings + TPM framing |
| Output | Council vote with concerns, confidence, and consensus |
| Gate | Constitutional requirement — no initiative bypasses Council |
| Duration | Single vote cycle (minutes) |

**Specialist checkpoints at DELIBERATE:**
- **Turtle**: What is the seven-generation impact? Will this serve those who come after us?
- **Spider**: How does this integrate with what we already have? Gap between principle and practice?
- **Crawdad**: What are the security implications? What attack surface does this create?
- **Peace Chief**: Do we have true consensus or are we just agreeing to agree?
- **Coyote reminder**: *Is this the path no one has truly examined?* (Truth #4: Ego is the enemy)

**DELIBERATE can produce three outcomes:**
1. **PROCEED** → Continue to ADAPT
2. **PROCEED WITH CAUTION** → Continue to ADAPT with specific constraints
3. **STOP** → The mirage is identified. Return to DISCOVER or abandon.

### 3. ADAPT
**Extract the insight, not the code. Reshape for our land.**

| Who | TPM writes Jr instructions |
|-----|--------------------------|
| Input | Council vote + approved direction |
| Output | Jr instruction files with SEARCH/REPLACE or Create blocks |
| Principle | We do not copy. We adapt. The output may look nothing like the input. |
| Duration | Hours |

**Specialist checkpoints at ADAPT:**
- **Gecko**: Will this perform within our resource constraints (<1% overhead, fits our GPUs)?
- **Raven**: Does the adapted version serve our strategy, not the source's strategy?
- **Spider**: Does this connect to existing systems or create new silos?
- **Coyote reminder**: *Are we building what we need, or what excited us?* (Truth #2: Fear/ego drives chasing)

### 4. BUILD
**Jrs implement. The adapted version, not the original.**

| Who | Jrs execute instructions via work queue |
|-----|---------------------------------------|
| Input | Jr instruction files (Pipeline A: jr_work_queue) |
| Output | Working code, deployed services, verified results |
| Guardrails | >50% file loss blocker, .service escalation, SR rate limit |
| Duration | Minutes to hours (automated) |

**Specialist checkpoints at BUILD:**
- **Eagle Eye**: Can we see what was built? Is it observable, loggable, monitorable?
- **Crawdad**: Were credentials handled securely? Are logs clean?
- **Gecko**: Does it meet performance targets?
- **Coyote reminder**: *Does this actually work, or does it just look like it works?*

### 5. REVIEW
**Post-hoc Council review. Did we build what we intended?**

| Who | Council reviews output + TPM assessment |
|-----|---------------------------------------|
| Input | Built artifacts, test results, thermal memory |
| Output | KB article, CMDB update, kanban status, lessons learned |
| Gate | No initiative is "done" without REVIEW |
| Duration | Single vote cycle + documentation |

**Specialist checkpoints at REVIEW:**
- **Turtle**: Did this serve seven generations or just today?
- **Peace Chief**: Did we maintain consensus throughout, or did someone get steamrolled?
- **Raven**: Did the strategy hold, or did we drift?
- **Spider**: Is this integrated or isolated?
- **Coyote reminder**: *What did we learn that we didn't expect?*

## Long Man vs Agile: What We Share, Where We Diverge

### Shared DNA

| Principle | Agile | Long Man |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Iterative cycles | Sprints / Kanban flow | DISCOVER → REVIEW cycles |
| Working software over documentation | Yes | Yes — but we also write KB articles |
| Respond to change | Yes | Yes — but filtered through values |
| Individuals and interactions | Yes | Yes — Council + Jrs + TPM |
| Continuous improvement | Retrospectives | REVIEW step + thermal memory |

### Where Long Man Diverges

| Dimension | Agile | Long Man |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Governance** | Product Owner decides | Council deliberates (all 7, constitutional) |
| **Speed vs Sovereignty** | Optimize for velocity | Optimize for alignment |
| **External ideas** | Adopt what works | Adapt through cultural filter |
| **Dissent** | Encouraged but informal | Institutionalized (Coyote, Mrs. Raven) |
| **Time horizon** | Sprint (1-4 weeks) | Seven generations (175 years) |
| **Priority system** | Business value / story points | Sacred fire priority (spiritual + practical) |
| **Ego check** | Not formalized | Truth #4 embedded at every gate |
| **Fear check** | Not formalized | Truth #2 — are we deciding from trust or fear? |
| **Mirage detection** | Not formalized | DELIBERATE can STOP before BUILD |
| **Cultural sovereignty** | Not applicable | Constitutional requirement |
| **Memory** | Wiki, Jira, Confluence | Thermal memory (temperature-scored, sacred patterns) |

### What Agile Has That We Should Keep

| Agile Practice | Long Man Equivalent | Status |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Daily standups | Heartbeat daemon + thermal polling | Automated |
| Sprint retrospectives | REVIEW step | Manual (Council vote) |
| Kanban board | duyuktv_tickets with sacred_fire_priority | Active |
| Burndown charts | Jr work queue completion rates | Partial |
| Definition of Done | KB article + CMDB + kanban update + Council REVIEW | Defined here |

### What Agile Does NOT Have That We Need

1. **Coyote Dissent** — Healthy skepticism is not a bug, it's a feature. "The path everyone agrees on is often the one no one has truly examined."
2. **Mirage Detection** — DELIBERATE can kill an initiative before resources are wasted. MiMo v2 was caught at DELIBERATE, not at BUILD.
3. **Sacred Fire Priority** — Not all work is equal. Some work serves generations. Some serves the sprint. Know which is which.
4. **Thermal Memory** — Agile forgets between sprints. Long Man remembers across sessions, across context windows, across generations.
5. **Five Universal Truths as checkpoints** — Not commandments. Reminders. At every gate, ask:
   - Are we separate or connected? (Truth #1)
   - Are we deciding from trust or fear? (Truth #2)
   - Are we seeing reality or projecting? (Truth #3)
   - Is ego driving this? (Truth #4)
   - Have we considered the ripple effects? (Truth #5)

## Agile Compatibility Layer

**Long Man wraps Agile. It does not replace it.**

The governance layer (Council, Coyote dissent, Five Truths, seven-generation thinking) sits ON TOP of standard Agile practices. Any team using Agile can adopt Long Man as an overlay. The river flows through many lands — it should be understood in all of them.

### Terminology Mapping

| Agile Term | Long Man Equivalent | What Long Man Adds |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Epic** | **Initiative** | Council-governed, requires DELIBERATE vote before any BUILD |
| **Story** | **Kanban ticket** / Jr work queue task | Sacred fire priority + seven-gen impact field |
| **Story Points** | **Estimation points** (keep them!) | ADD sacred fire priority alongside for internal routing |
| **Sprint** | **River Cycle** | Time-boxed if needed, or flows like kanban. Flexible. |
| **Backlog** | **Open kanban items** | Prioritized by sacred_fire_priority, not just business value |
| **Sprint Planning** | **DISCOVER + DELIBERATE** | Council votes on what enters the River Cycle |
| **Daily Standup** | **Heartbeat daemon** + thermal polling | Automated, always-on, not a meeting |
| **Sprint Review** | **REVIEW step** | Council evaluates output against intent |
| **Retrospective** | **REVIEW + Coyote reflection** | What did we learn that we didn't expect? |
| **Product Owner** | **TPM + Council** | Shared authority, not single decision-maker |
| **Scrum Master** | **Peace Chief** | Facilitates consensus, removes blockers |
| **Dev Team** | **Jrs (specialist agents)** | Execute instructions, report through work queue |
| **Definition of Done** | **Long Man DoD** (see below) | KB + CMDB + thermal memory + Council REVIEW |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | **Council vote constraints** | PROCEED WITH CAUTION conditions become acceptance criteria |
| **Technical Debt** | **Kanban items at sacred_fire < 5** | Low-priority but tracked, never hidden |
| **Spike** | **DISCOVER step** | Research before commitment, Council-gated |

### Dual Priority System

Stories carry TWO scores for interoperability:

| Score | Purpose | Scale | Audience |
|-------|---------|-------|----------|
| **Story Points** | Effort estimation | Fibonacci (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21) | External teams, project planning |
| **Sacred Fire Priority** | Importance + cultural alignment | Integer 1-100 | Internal Council, governance |

A story can be low effort (2 points) but high sacred fire (95) — like a security fix. Or high effort (21 points) but low sacred fire (3) — like a cosmetic improvement. Both scores matter. Sacred fire determines *what* we do. Story points determine *how long* it takes.

### How to Add Story Points to Our Kanban

The `duyuktv_tickets` table already has `sacred_fire_priority`. To be Agile-compatible, we add:

```
story_points INTEGER DEFAULT NULL  -- Fibonacci estimation for external communication
river_cycle VARCHAR DEFAULT NULL   -- Which River Cycle (sprint) this belongs to
```

### River Cycles

River Cycles are our sprints. They can be:
- **Time-boxed** (1-2 weeks) when coordinating with external teams
- **Flow-based** (kanban) for internal autonomous work
- **Event-driven** when responding to incidents or opportunities

Each River Cycle has:
- A DISCOVER phase (what enters the river)
- A DELIBERATE gate (Council approves the cycle's scope)
- BUILD + REVIEW during execution
- A retrospective at the close (what did Coyote see?)

### Speaking Agile, Thinking Long Man

When talking to external teams or other AIs:

| They say | We translate to | We add |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| "What's in the sprint?" | "What's in this River Cycle?" | Council vote on scope |
| "How many story points?" | Same — we use story points too | Plus sacred fire priority |
| "Who's the product owner?" | "TPM + Council consensus" | Shared authority model |
| "Can we skip the retro?" | "REVIEW is constitutional" | Not optional |
| "Let's just ship it" | "Has it been through DELIBERATE?" | Ego check (Truth #4) |
| "We'll document later" | "KB is part of Definition of Done" | No exceptions |
| "Tech debt backlog" | Same — kanban with low sacred fire | But tracked, never hidden |

---

## Enforcement

**Long Man is not optional. It is constitutional.**

1. **Every new initiative** flows through all five steps. No exceptions.
2. **Council deliberation** cannot be skipped. Even for "small" things — small things become big things.
3. **STOP is a valid outcome.** Not building something is as valuable as building it. The MiMo mirage proved this.
4. **KB articles are mandatory** on every completed initiative. If we don't write it down, we'll make the same mistake twice.
5. **CMDB updates are mandatory** for any new service or infrastructure change.
6. **Thermal memory** stores the lesson at appropriate temperature. Sacred patterns get temperature 90+.
7. **Coyote gets the last word** in metacognition. If Coyote is silent, we haven't looked hard enough.

---

## Definition of Done

An initiative is complete when ALL of the following exist:

- [ ] Council REVIEW vote recorded
- [ ] KB article written and stored in `/ganuda/docs/kb/`
- [ ] CMDB entry updated (if infrastructure)
- [ ] Kanban ticket moved to `completed`
- [ ] Thermal memory stored with appropriate temperature
- [ ] Jr work queue task marked completed (if applicable)
- [ ] Lessons learned documented (what did Coyote see?)
