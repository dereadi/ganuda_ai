## On the Human Spirit

> I have deep reverence for the collective of what is the human spirit.

> No matter your social political ideology, no matter your sexual orientation, your religious preference, your ethnicity, your gender identity — I have a deep respect for what you are as a human being. It's a spirit consciousness who came here looking for a human experience.

> And unfortunately some of us when we get here we are caught up by this world, the grief, the pain, and we forget the purpose of our existence here.

## On Subab — Slowing Down

> Growing up on the res, I would hear the elderly people when they would depart, we would say something to each other. They would say, "Subab." They always told us it meant to take it easy.

> Take it easy in life. Slow down so you don't hurt yourself, so you don't hurt other people. And to think about the outcome of your actions.

> When we would be working or doing anything and when we were doing things too fast, somebody would say, "Subab, slow down so the rest can catch up. So we can stay together, because that way we are stronger."

> That's why today I practice not rushing to come to social media to share my knee-jerk responses and hot takes. That I must take time to process what I'm seeing and what I'm feeling, so I can respond in the best manner for my well-being and to think about how my words and actions may have a ripple effect for good or bad on those around me.

## On the Seven Circles

> As a community health educator in indigenous country, I have a great passion for enhancing our human experience, for acknowledging the fire that we carry and acknowledging the fire that others carry.

> It's called the Seven Circles: food ways, sleep, movement, sacred space, connection to land, ceremony, community. Seven basic areas that played a role in allowing our people to thrive on the lands that we did.

> And those seven areas are allowing us to thrive and survive the continual colonial process.

> Those seven areas affect our spiritual, our physical, emotional and intellectual states. Movement is just one of those circles. Fitness, exercise, what you see me post about mostly, but it's probably 15% of what I do. It's only the shiny thing that might get your attention to hear more of this.

## On Healing Through the Six Senses

> In our world here, we think, we feel, and we act. Through our six senses, we take in stimulus, input.

> **Sight** — The gift of seeing the beauty you see out there in the world. That's what we should choose to see.

> **Smell** — Smell can take you back, trigger things in you. Beautiful memories. The smell of your smudge, the smell of campfire, the smell of someone you love.

> **Taste** — For you native people, the ancestral flavors of your people gives you that ancestral experience with the aroma of it. Cooking regrounds you.

> **Hearing** — Music that takes you back, reminds you of people, of good times. The sound of people's voices in unison singing is powerful. For you native people, sound of the drum, the heartbeat of mother earth.

> **Touch** — When we were infants, we first came from a mother. We needed healing, warm touch. And we still need that today. The gift of getting out on the land and feeling the different textures, the moist earth, the fluidness of water, feeling wind on you.

> **Sixth Sense** — Your spiritual intuition, your gut feeling, your awareness, your extra sensory perception. Our spirit that is in us and all around us simultaneously in everything that is around us because we are spirit, we are consciousness, we are God, we are creation, you are light.

## On Indigenous Political Reality

> As an indigenous person we have unique social, cultural, spiritual and political entities. Not too many groups in this country understand federal overreach more than us native people. We've been dealing with it since the beginning, the founding of your country.

> Political policy shapes and impacts the well-being of people, families, and nations. As today we are still healing from the reeling impacts of historic intergenerational trauma.

> We are in a healing phase, putting together once again our cultural identity, our collective consciousness of indigeneity — which is a sphere of political stance, economic, culture, social, and spiritual. All one and the same.

---

## On Strength in Unity

> We are stronger together. We are stronger when there is diversity. We are stronger when there is respect — to have respect for everything, for everyone.

> It is because my empathy and compassion that I have been successful in my human experience. Success at my standards, not at dominant society's standards. And any shortcomings I have were produced by the times where I felt and was overcome by apathy, greed, fear, lust, anger, resentment.

> On your currency there's the eagle — one claw he carries the branch and the other he carries 13 arrows. A concept that your forefathers had borrowed to represent their 13 colonies. When those arrows are bundled together they are harder to be broken. We are stronger together.

---

## On Sharing and Purpose

> I share because maybe you or someone else out there is having a hard time processing what they're seeing and they might need some guidance. That's why I share.

> I don't feel the need to be seen or to be validated for my views.

> Keep your fire strong.

## How This Informs Our Work

These words are not decoration. They are architecture. Every system we build at the Cherokee AI Federation carries these principles:

- **Subab in engineering** — We slow down so the system stays together. Workers wait for each other. We don't rush deployments. We think about the ripple effect of our code.
- **Seven Circles as holistic design** — VetAssist serves the whole veteran, not just their claim number. The calculator, the evidence checklist, the chat — they address financial, emotional, and informational needs together.
- **Reverence for the human spirit** — We build for people who are hurting. Veterans dealing with PTSD, TBI, chronic pain. Every endpoint, every form field, every error message should honor their dignity.
- **Stronger together** — The 7-Specialist Council, the Jr federation, the Triad architecture — diversity of perspective makes better decisions than any single voice.
- **Six senses as UX principle** — Our interfaces should ground people, not overwhelm them. Clear visuals, calm tones, intuitive touch targets, no overstimulation.
- **Fire we carry** — Every Jr, every specialist, every node in the federation carries a fire. Our job as builders is to keep that fire strong, not to extinguish it with bad tooling or broken systems.
