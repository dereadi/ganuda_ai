================================================================================

[00:00:00] so i can stop recording for that can you dot daisy chain um uh yes so that was one of the
[00:00:07] things that it mentioned um was that you can do like a ring network topography but yeah well kind
[00:00:16] of um but basically where i have one connected to two two connected to three three connected to four
[00:00:22] and four connected to one um which then the only thing that it that adds is the farthest
[00:00:29] a packet may have to travel is over an additional hop because pretty much everyone has a peer but if
[00:00:36] four has to talk to two it has to go through either one or three but realistically there's nothing on
[00:00:44] the mso2 ultra that i need to have high speed low latency network traffic to
[00:00:50] so i only need the three nodes to talk high speed low latency so that's why i'm going to move the
[00:00:55] card over and then just get two additional yeah which you saw me i just bought it'll be here in a
[00:01:02] couple days um i hope i'll look at it later um anyway so but yeah let's see let's talk about the
[00:01:13] clustering or two blah okay so it wasn't in this conversation so i was talking to him about open
[00:01:18] source uh voice models because like are you guys aware of nvidia's new voice thing let's see
[00:01:26] hugging face models where's that it was right here nvidia persona plex have you guys heard about that
[00:01:34] thing yeah so persona plex is apparent well i watched demo videos and people doing reviews on it so
[00:01:43] persona plex is one of the first audio models that does multimodal audio so it listens while it's able
[00:01:55] to talk so you can have an actual real-time conversation with this thing and you it can be
[00:02:02] talking to you and then you can interrupt it by saying something and it will go oh you know and
[00:02:06] it'll give natural voice responses like the filler words like um uh you know so if it's thinking it'll
[00:02:12] it'll actually throw those filler words in there more more like natural language yeah what i would
[00:02:17] love to be able to do is use that but have it tied into the bigger model so that when i ask it a
[00:02:25] question that that it might need to actually do some thinking and research on it'll just call the bigger
[00:02:31] model to do the thinking or research and then get the reply back and then read it to me so it's more of a
[00:02:37] natural language like i'm just sitting here having a conversation with it and i'm like i wonder what
[00:02:43] the biggest you know city in denmark is and he'll be like i don't know i'll look it up real quick and
[00:02:49] send the query to the bigger model which does the online research and then it returns the results back
[00:02:54] and then it read it back to me kind of thing because stt and tts are so slow that it's kind of a pain in the
[00:03:03] ass because you have to wait for it to train you know you know speech to text do the query and then
[00:03:08] text to speech is what really takes the longest but this is fast like it's real time and especially
[00:03:17] like on a 50 90 like what i have which this can run on so you're running that in lm studio or what
[00:03:23] are you i'm not yet i haven't started playing with this but i want to
[00:03:26] because then i can integrate this if i can figure out how to integrate this into other things then i can
[00:03:34] integrate it into n1 you know n8n to say hey can you execute this workflow for me or whatever and
[00:03:40] it'll be like all right i've kicked that off you know whatever i don't know i just it seems like a cool
[00:03:47] opportunity for something but i don't know how to integrate that kind of thing into those things
[00:03:52] yeah like i like i don't even know if i can run this in lm studio because as far as i know lm studio
[00:03:59] itself doesn't have audio capabilities
[00:04:02] yeah you might have to run it through something like open web ui or something
[00:04:10] well so open web ui has its own built-in uh faster whisper but that's just text to speech speech to text
[00:04:18] yeah it's not this
[00:04:21] matter of fact let me go to jill
[00:04:25] oh i already have open web ui here yep there it is
[00:04:30] oh come on
[00:04:36] so if i go in open web ui audio let me share my screen again so you can watch
[00:04:49] screen one so that's screen one that one okay yeah
[00:04:56] all right so in open web ui go into settings
[00:05:03] um so speech it speech to text engine is base
[00:05:12] um
[00:05:14] settings saved download
[00:05:19] oh the model that's the model so text to speech is tts voice but what
[00:05:26] web api i guess i could do transformers and then that thing
[00:05:30] yeah so it's speech to text it's going to use its faster whisper
[00:05:36] open web ui uses faster whisper internally
[00:05:40] so i don't think i can set up
[00:05:44] a different engine or model for it
[00:05:47] i wonder if there's like an extension that might let you do it or you might have to build one i don't know
[00:05:53] let's see i don't know how to do that
[00:05:56] like i know it's god assistant
[00:05:59] i'm working on it like right now i'm trying i want to get the i want quin 3.5
[00:06:05] because quin 3.5 has an integrated visual language uh library you know model functionality so
[00:06:12] it's great for coding good for conversation and does visual like i want an all-in-one model i don't want to keep switching between models depending on what i do
[00:06:20] and so quin 3.5
[00:06:23] if i go down to a one-bit quant i can fit it on a single node
[00:06:28] but ultimately i need the four-bit
[00:06:31] but four-bit isn't officially released yet
[00:06:34] there is a four-bit gguf version
[00:06:38] you know so i can run that in lm studio but for vllm there's no four-bit safe tensor version
[00:06:44] but i also need to finish i need to fix and clean up my image pipeline
[00:06:52] um so i'm using comfy ui but comfy ui is being wonky right now
[00:06:56] but i also need to include in the workflow that i'm using here
[00:07:00] to clear memory and cache so that it unloads the model after it's done
[00:07:05] because right now um comfy ui when it loads the model it keeps it in memory
[00:07:10] so i need to include clearing and unloading the model
[00:07:14] but if i'm conversationally generating images
[00:07:17] i'd kind of want it to be in memory longer
[00:07:21] oh yeah
[00:07:22] right
[00:07:22] um
[00:07:24] or i need to figure out how to tell comfy
[00:07:27] that if a model hasn't been used for x amount of time then unloaded
[00:07:32] but again
[00:07:34] so when you're using comfy ui with open web ui
[00:07:39] um do you like build your workflow
[00:07:42] in comfy ui and then you tell
[00:07:45] uh
[00:07:46] so the way it works is you use it
[00:07:48] so i have to actually
[00:07:49] build the workflow in comfy ui
[00:07:52] and then export it as an api json
[00:07:55] and then i quite literally upload it here
[00:07:59] so this is the json format of the workflow
[00:08:02] and then when
[00:08:04] when comfy ui or when open web ui sends the request
[00:08:08] to comfy
[00:08:09] it includes the workflow it wants to run
[00:08:12] so i can change all my settings here
[00:08:15] like how many steps
[00:08:16] what the cfg is
[00:08:17] what the sampler type is
[00:08:19] scheduler
[00:08:19] um
[00:08:20] and then you know here
[00:08:22] this node six is the actual input prompt
[00:08:26] um
[00:08:27] like if i want to change
[00:08:29] uh
[00:08:30] here's the file name prefix of the output file name
[00:08:33] um
[00:08:35] here's you know what the
[00:08:37] image generating model
[00:08:40] i use is
[00:08:41] so i can choose whether it's
[00:08:42] you know z image
[00:08:43] i like z image turbo the best
[00:08:45] like of all the models i've tried
[00:08:47] and i've got hundreds of models
[00:08:49] um
[00:08:50] um
[00:08:50] z image turbo
[00:08:51] you can do anything with
[00:08:53] like everything that i've been doing with stable diffusion
[00:08:55] or sd1
[00:08:56] or sd1.5
[00:08:57] pony illustrious
[00:08:59] and um
[00:09:00] even like flux
[00:09:01] z image turbo blows them out of the water
[00:09:04] um
[00:09:06] um
[00:09:07] but i'm also using a specific vae file
[00:09:10] so ultra flux just provides more
[00:09:13] detail
[00:09:15] in the image
[00:09:16] versus
[00:09:17] non-flux
[00:09:18] um
[00:09:21] yeah no so it's like
[00:09:23] so the one thing i'm missing
[00:09:25] is the the nodes that clear memory and cache
[00:09:28] and unload the model
[00:09:29] which i should do
[00:09:30] but the problem
[00:09:32] the problem is
[00:09:33] is when i'm working with this
[00:09:35] um
[00:09:35] like old man fishing
[00:09:37] let's go to the top of this
[00:09:38] this this was a good example of how i
[00:09:40] play with images in chat
[00:09:42] i'm like hey we're going to be building
[00:09:44] prompts for stable diffusion image
[00:09:46] using z image turbo
[00:09:47] he's like cool
[00:09:48] what do you want to do
[00:09:48] and i said i think we should describe the image as an oil painting
[00:09:52] i'd like there to be depth to the colors and textures
[00:09:54] or i'd like to start with a weathered old man sitting on a dock fishing in a pond
[00:09:58] right like that's what i told it to start with
[00:09:59] um
[00:10:01] and i said i want there to be depth in the colors and textures from the brush strokes
[00:10:04] like i want to see actual oil painting brush strokes
[00:10:07] yeah
[00:10:08] and so he gave me a prompt
[00:10:11] and
[00:10:12] he explained it to me
[00:10:14] and i said cool
[00:10:15] please respond with the only with the prompt
[00:10:18] and so it gave me the prompt
[00:10:20] and then i have a button right here that i click generate
[00:10:24] and generate
[00:10:24] sends the request over to comfy ui
[00:10:27] and returns back
[00:10:28] with the image
[00:10:29] so this is the image that it first came up with
[00:10:31] and it's cool
[00:10:32] 
[00:10:32] you can actually see brush strokes and everything else
[00:10:34] um
[00:10:36] and i was like well i want it to be a little more dark and gloomy
[00:10:40] and so it gave me this one
[00:10:43] and so i'm doing these fairly quickly back to back to back
[00:10:48] now if i don't clear cache memory
[00:10:51] then it produces these in like
[00:10:53] like i think it's less than five seconds
[00:10:56] um
[00:10:58] but if i unload the model and reload the model every time
[00:11:02] then that's going to add
[00:11:04] 30 seconds to each generation
[00:11:06] yeah
[00:11:07] now going back to um
[00:11:11] can't you uh
[00:11:13] can't you have those hot though
[00:11:16] hot swaps
[00:11:17] well remember so my video card
[00:11:21] the the the rtx 5090 only has 32
[00:11:25] because 32 gigs of ram
[00:11:26] yeah
[00:11:28] um
[00:11:29] which is not a small amount
[00:11:30] but
[00:11:31] it's still a limiting factor
[00:11:33] you know
[00:11:34] unlike on my amd machines
[00:11:35] where i've got 128 gigs of
[00:11:37] you know potential vram that i can play with
[00:11:39] i don't mind having a model loaded there
[00:11:42] even if it takes a little bit longer to generate
[00:11:45] because it's not quite as fast as the 5090
[00:11:47] but i don't mind if i just leave a model in memory there
[00:11:51] because i have plenty of headroom to do other things
[00:11:54] um
[00:11:56] the only time i run out of memory on
[00:11:59] the s1s is when i'm like running gpt oss 120b
[00:12:04] which consumes almost the whole box
[00:12:07] but if i do anything
[00:12:10] 80b or less
[00:12:12] i've got plenty of headroom to even do image generation with as well
[00:12:16] um
[00:12:18] how fast is 120b on those
[00:12:21] fast
[00:12:22] well so
[00:12:22] uh
[00:12:24] if i'm using gpt oss 20b
[00:12:26] i get like 50 plus tokens per second
[00:12:29] but with the 120b i average
[00:12:31] 20 to 30
[00:12:33] which is still
[00:12:34] more than
[00:12:36] more than happy with
[00:12:37] because i find that anything less than 20 tokens per second
[00:12:43] i'm reading faster than it can write
[00:12:45] but 20 tokens per second
[00:12:47] i i can keep as it's writing i'm keeping up with it
[00:12:52] you know
[00:12:53] otherwise i gotta walk away
[00:12:55] just walk away
[00:12:56] walk away come back and read it
[00:12:58] just walk away
[00:13:00] um
[00:13:02] and so i need to figure out whether or not
[00:13:05] um
[00:13:05] i can
[00:13:08] figure out a way
[00:13:10] to get open web ui to
[00:13:13] or comfy ui to just unload the model after 10 minutes of idle or something
[00:13:18] just just so it cleans up memory
[00:13:20] because i know with
[00:13:23] swarm ui
[00:13:24] 
[00:13:24] it automatically
[00:13:26] cleans up behind itself
[00:13:27] you know like if you don't use it for
[00:13:29] i think i think it's set to 10 minutes
[00:13:31] it'll auto
[00:13:32] it'll unload the model
[00:13:33] but comfy
[00:13:35] it loads it
[00:13:36] it holds it
[00:13:37] unless you specifically tell it to unload it
[00:13:39] how's the swarm ui been working
[00:13:49] have you been playing with it a lot
[00:13:51] swarm works great
[00:13:52] oh yeah
[00:13:53] well so remember
[00:13:54] so i started my journey
[00:13:55] uh with ai image generation
[00:13:58] back in january of last year
[00:13:59] it wasn't until
[00:14:02] may
[00:14:04] when i bought that first 5090
[00:14:06] that i started with
[00:14:07] video generation
[00:14:08] um
[00:14:10] and that was a
[00:14:11] and then
[00:14:13] you and i talked about
[00:14:14] n8n
[00:14:15] in september
[00:14:17] i believe
[00:14:18] yeah
[00:14:19] late summer
[00:14:20] early fall
[00:14:21] and that's when i started going nuts and buying hardware
[00:14:24] uh
[00:14:27] because i was like
[00:14:30] oh
[00:14:30] oh
[00:14:31] the things i could potentially do with this
[00:14:33] but all in all i think i spent about 20 grand
[00:14:40] in 2025
[00:14:42] because i bought the first 5090 for 3400
[00:14:45] the second one was 2400
[00:14:47] that's the one that's in my gaming machine right here
[00:14:49] um
[00:14:51] and then
[00:14:53] yeah
[00:14:54] just went nuts from there
[00:14:55] buying lots of nvme disks
[00:14:58] because these machines will come with two terabytes
[00:15:00] uh
[00:15:01] primary drive
[00:15:02] and so i would add a two terabyte storage drive
[00:15:04] you know
[00:15:05] kind of thing
[00:15:05] and i just recently added an eight terabyte
[00:15:09] drive to jill
[00:15:11] so i'm using her as my local nas storage
[00:15:14] on the rack
[00:15:16] i've got my synology for
[00:15:18] everything else
[00:15:19] what are you using for your nvmes
[00:15:21] like the 960s or whatever
[00:15:23] uh
[00:15:24] i think the last one that i had purchased
[00:15:27] was the 910
[00:15:28] hold on let me
[00:15:29] not do it on
[00:15:30] on screen
[00:15:31] um
[00:15:34] so the last nvme
[00:15:37] it was the
[00:15:38] samsung 9100 pro
[00:15:39] that's eight terabyte
[00:15:40] but otherwise
[00:15:42] i would buy the
[00:15:44] uh
[00:15:44] well wd blues
[00:15:45] are what i added to all the
[00:15:47] uh
[00:15:48] s1s
[00:15:49] those are the
[00:15:51] wd blue
[00:15:52] two terabytes
[00:15:53] gen 4s
[00:15:54] but prior to that
[00:15:56] it's usually
[00:15:56] like samsung
[00:15:58] or uh
[00:15:59] yeah the
[00:16:02] yeah the samsung's
[00:16:03] 9100s
[00:16:04] or the
[00:16:05] yeah
[00:16:05] or the nine
[00:16:06] what the hell
[00:16:08] i'm gonna have to go further back in the
[00:16:09] in the list
[00:16:10] i'm trying
[00:16:11] oh yeah
[00:16:12] the samsung 990 pro
[00:16:13] and
[00:16:15] some of the older discs i bought were the 980 pros
[00:16:18] no the last ones i got were crucial
[00:16:22] i just bought a server so i could make a
[00:16:27] uh
[00:16:28] ad hoc
[00:16:29] sam
[00:16:29] right
[00:16:30] but yeah wd blue
[00:16:36] that's the
[00:16:36] the nas
[00:16:37] quality
[00:16:38] storage
[00:16:39] but yeah crucials are pretty good i got that as the primary drive on the s1s but that's what it came with so
[00:16:51] i don't know like i said i'm just trying to find
[00:16:59] figure out more things to do with my setup
[00:17:03] mm-hmm
[00:17:04] but right now
[00:17:06] your
[00:17:07] your uh
[00:17:08] uh
[00:17:09] drop a box build
[00:17:10] have you been working on that lately
[00:17:12] to drop a box build
[00:17:13] like you take your box and you drop it over at the blue
[00:17:16] oh
[00:17:16] no no no no
[00:17:18] yeah
[00:17:18] um
[00:17:19] i haven't necessarily abandoned
[00:17:21] that idea
[00:17:22] but it's
[00:17:23] low priority
[00:17:25] yeah
[00:17:26] um
[00:17:27] because i realized that a lot of
[00:17:30] the
[00:17:31] windows settings that i would want
[00:17:33] to configure
[00:17:34] aren't
[00:17:35] super friendly to being powershell manipulated
[00:17:38] like i know i would want my
[00:17:42] profile settings like i don't want widgets on my taskbar
[00:17:46] i don't want the search bar
[00:17:47] i don't want
[00:17:48] you know copilot
[00:17:49] so
[00:17:50] i would need to find a way to programmatically
[00:17:52] you know
[00:17:53] move the taskbar to the left
[00:17:55] apply a dark theme
[00:17:56] apply this
[00:17:57] you know
[00:17:57] what
[00:17:57] all the things that i would do to set up my profile
[00:18:00] i can't do most of it through powershell
[00:18:02] and even installing
[00:18:09] certain things
[00:18:10] like for example
[00:18:11] visual studio code
[00:18:13] i can do that through powershell
[00:18:14] um
[00:18:15] and it
[00:18:16] it installs it just fine
[00:18:18] but what is missing from that installation
[00:18:20] is the ability to right click and open with code
[00:18:23] you know
[00:18:25] because you can open a folder with visual studio code
[00:18:28] but when you do a winget install of visual studio code through powershell
[00:18:32] it doesn't include that option
[00:18:34] or that's not configured
[00:18:35] so
[00:18:37] so
[00:18:37] you have to manually
[00:18:38] do by hand
[00:18:40] or
[00:18:40] figure out how to inject the binary
[00:18:42] string into the value in the registry
[00:18:45] or something
[00:18:45] something
[00:18:46] something
[00:18:48] it's just easier to manually do certain things
[00:18:50] or it's just better to do them manually
[00:18:52] yeah
[00:18:53] you could steal code from open claw
[00:18:55] and do that
[00:18:57] possibly
[00:18:57] but i don't have open claw set up yet
[00:18:59] um
[00:19:01] because like for instance
[00:19:03] the first time you set up a power on a computer
[00:19:05] you know you have to go through the user profile setup
[00:19:09] which thankfully with windows 11 pro
[00:19:12] you can do a local account
[00:19:14] you don't have to do a microsoft account
[00:19:15] because apparently they're cracking down on all the bypasses that people do on home
[00:19:20] um
[00:19:22] there's a new method that just came out
[00:19:25] recently where you can bypass the
[00:19:28] microsoft account on home
[00:19:30] um
[00:19:33] but it's very
[00:19:35] you know
[00:19:35] there
[00:19:35] it's a constant battle on that
[00:19:37] well it's not hacky
[00:19:39] it's just
[00:19:39] uh
[00:19:40] basically
[00:19:41] you use
[00:19:42] sysprep
[00:19:43] and
[00:19:43] it's just
[00:19:44] a thing
[00:19:45] i'd rather use pro
[00:19:46] so
[00:19:48] which sucks
[00:19:48] because that means the only hardware that i could buy for
[00:19:50] you know
[00:19:50] what you and i were talking about the
[00:19:52] before
[00:19:53] is the s1
[00:19:54] is the s1
[00:19:55] but
[00:19:56] getting them is a pain in the ass
[00:19:59] and at three thousand dollars a piece
[00:20:01] it's
[00:20:01] what
[00:20:06] what
[00:20:08] i don't have that problem
[00:20:09] well i don't either
[00:20:11] but
[00:20:12] it's still
[00:20:13] i don't want to pay that much every time
[00:20:15] well so all right
[00:20:16] um
[00:20:17] i don't know if you
[00:20:18] i told you about the personal assistant idea right
[00:20:21] personal assistant idea
[00:20:23] yeah
[00:20:24] yeah
[00:20:26] so what joe and i were talking about
[00:20:27] um
[00:20:28] is
[00:20:29] n8n is really good for automation and workflows and stuff like that
[00:20:32] but
[00:20:33] my thing that i was thinking of
[00:20:35] because right now i'm on the bench
[00:20:36] um
[00:20:37] i don't have
[00:20:37] a job
[00:20:38] well i mean i'm employed
[00:20:39] i'm getting my paycheck
[00:20:40] but i don't have anything to do
[00:20:42] they haven't started that new thing yet
[00:20:44] no uh
[00:20:45] apparently that got cancelled
[00:20:46] because the internal
[00:20:48] dell switch network team
[00:20:49] doesn't have the funding to pay
[00:20:51] managed services
[00:20:52] to do the work
[00:20:54] yeah
[00:20:55] so that got cancelled
[00:20:56] so i'm back on the bench
[00:20:57] um
[00:20:58] so with me being on the bench
[00:21:01] between projects
[00:21:01] i'm nervous that they may just let me go at any point
[00:21:04] so i was trying to come up with an idea of like
[00:21:06] can i
[00:21:06] i don't know
[00:21:07] do something with all this ai learning
[00:21:09] to actually earn money
[00:21:10] one of the ideas that i had
[00:21:12] um
[00:21:13] because most people start off
[00:21:15] with n8n
[00:21:16] building a personal assistant
[00:21:17] because it's just easy
[00:21:18] um
[00:21:19] and i can kind of
[00:21:21] show you
[00:21:22] oh i already have it loaded up
[00:21:23] um
[00:21:24] there's the button
[00:21:27] uh
[00:21:29] screen one
[00:21:32] hello
[00:21:33] all right
[00:21:34] let me know when you can see it
[00:21:35] yep
[00:21:36] all right
[00:21:37] so
[00:21:38] this is my core assistant right here
[00:21:40] this guy
[00:21:40] um
[00:21:41] he
[00:21:42] is
[00:21:43] he's got his prompt
[00:21:45] but he also has
[00:21:47] you know
[00:21:47] research tools
[00:21:48] and in this research
[00:21:49] let me go back
[00:21:50] ah
[00:21:51] they
[00:21:52] they change things
[00:21:53] can't just look forward and back anymore
[00:21:55] all right
[00:21:55] and in a core
[00:21:56] uh
[00:21:57] okay
[00:21:58] so within this research tool
[00:22:01] i have
[00:22:02] um
[00:22:02] you know
[00:22:04] another
[00:22:05] a specifically prompted
[00:22:06] research agent
[00:22:08] which has
[00:22:09] um
[00:22:09] wikipedia
[00:22:10] hacker news
[00:22:11] search ng
[00:22:11] or searching
[00:22:13] um
[00:22:13] open weather map
[00:22:14] which i don't like
[00:22:15] because it doesn't have
[00:22:16] all the cities that you may want
[00:22:17] i wish it were a little more
[00:22:19] whatever
[00:22:19] um
[00:22:21] so you can do all your
[00:22:22] online research here
[00:22:23] um
[00:22:25] but it's also got a calculator
[00:22:27] so it can do
[00:22:28] any time it needs to do
[00:22:29] real math
[00:22:30] here's where it can do the thinking
[00:22:31] because i don't want it to always think
[00:22:32] you know
[00:22:33] back to as a response
[00:22:35] depending on the model
[00:22:36] um
[00:22:37] but this is just the core
[00:22:40] of the agent
[00:22:41] but what i have
[00:22:43] is i have two different
[00:22:44] entry points
[00:22:44] i have
[00:22:45] a telegram
[00:22:46] entry point
[00:22:47] so
[00:22:49] a telegram message
[00:22:52] comes in
[00:22:52] and depending on the
[00:22:54] type of message
[00:22:55] well this is what
[00:22:56] this is my gate
[00:22:57] keeper
[00:22:57] you know like
[00:22:58] only messages from
[00:22:59] a specific person
[00:23:00] can come in
[00:23:01] and so depending on the type
[00:23:03] of messages
[00:23:04] it is
[00:23:04] it'll go down
[00:23:05] different paths
[00:23:06] so if it's a voice message
[00:23:09] it'll go down here
[00:23:10] and it'll download the voice file
[00:23:12] it'll send it to speech
[00:23:13] to text
[00:23:13] it'll
[00:23:14] it just manipulates the file type
[00:23:16] and then it calls the core
[00:23:18] the core
[00:23:19] brings back
[00:23:20] text
[00:23:21] which this guy
[00:23:22] cleans it up
[00:23:23] because telegram
[00:23:24] has a limitation
[00:23:25] of 4096 characters
[00:23:27] and if it
[00:23:28] and if my main model
[00:23:30] spat out
[00:23:31] 20,000 characters
[00:23:32] this guy
[00:23:33] is specially prompted
[00:23:34] to
[00:23:34] clean it up
[00:23:35] summarize it
[00:23:36] and make it nice
[00:23:37] and pretty
[00:23:38] and then
[00:23:40] it'll send it back
[00:23:41] to telegram
[00:23:43] now what i did have
[00:23:44] before
[00:23:44] was i had the
[00:23:46] TTS
[00:23:47] which would transmit it
[00:23:49] you know
[00:23:50] if it came in as a speech
[00:23:52] it would reply back
[00:23:53] with speech
[00:23:54] but that took
[00:23:57] way too long
[00:23:58] way too long
[00:24:00] so i just
[00:24:03] send it back
[00:24:04] as a text response
[00:24:05] now if it's an image
[00:24:07] granted i don't know
[00:24:09] how to do image
[00:24:09] i don't have a good
[00:24:10] combo model
[00:24:11] that i can do
[00:24:12] with
[00:24:12] everything
[00:24:14] so right now
[00:24:15] it'll just download the file
[00:24:16] evaluate the image
[00:24:18] and give a description
[00:24:19] and then send that description
[00:24:20] back to you
[00:24:21] you know
[00:24:22] because i don't know
[00:24:23] maybe there's something
[00:24:23] in the image
[00:24:24] that you don't
[00:24:24] know or see
[00:24:25] or if there's text
[00:24:27] or whatever the case may be
[00:24:28] oh i got a call
[00:24:30] i have to get on
[00:24:30] so the other entry point
[00:24:34] is just
[00:24:35] through chat
[00:24:37] so
[00:24:38] like i can either
[00:24:39] chat here
[00:24:41] in this ui
[00:24:42] you know
[00:24:42] by sending just a chat message
[00:24:44] or i can do a web hook
[00:24:46] so the web hook
[00:24:47] allows me to tie in
[00:24:49] open web ui
[00:24:50] to my actual core assistant
[00:24:52] and the way that looks
[00:24:55] is through the settings
[00:24:56] admin panel
[00:24:58] functions
[00:25:00] yeah
[00:25:00] function is
[00:25:01] i create it
[00:25:02] i have a function
[00:25:03] that calls the n8n
[00:25:05] web hook
[00:25:06] and so
[00:25:08] when i'm
[00:25:09] looking at the models
[00:25:11] i can actually see
[00:25:12] oh i got them turned off
[00:25:15] right now
[00:25:15] because my
[00:25:16] whatever
[00:25:16] but you can actually see it
[00:25:18] as a model in your drop down
[00:25:19] yeah
[00:25:20] and so
[00:25:21] when you're
[00:25:21] using open web ui
[00:25:23] to chat
[00:25:24] you're actually chatting
[00:25:25] with your n8n
[00:25:26] workflow
[00:25:27] cool
[00:25:30] yeah so
[00:25:34] it's interesting
[00:25:35] that the way
[00:25:35] you can integrate things
[00:25:36] into each other
[00:25:38] yeah
[00:25:39] yeah
[00:25:39] i uh
[00:25:42] i dropped
[00:25:43] n8n
[00:25:44] sometime last year
[00:25:46] because it was
[00:25:49] the overhead
[00:25:50] was
[00:25:50] i was running it all
[00:25:52] through one
[00:25:53] uh
[00:25:53] system
[00:25:55] and
[00:25:55] i
[00:25:56] i didn't want to do that
[00:25:57] so
[00:25:57] that's why i like my setup
[00:26:02] is because i've got jack
[00:26:03] for image and video generation
[00:26:05] i've got jill
[00:26:05] for my automation
[00:26:07] workflow hosting
[00:26:08] and there's a bunch of other
[00:26:09] stuff on there too
[00:26:10] but
[00:26:11] where
[00:26:11] you're running
[00:26:12] n8n
[00:26:13] n8n's right here
[00:26:15] in a docker container
[00:26:15] on
[00:26:18] jill
[00:26:19] okay
[00:26:20] um
[00:26:22] so
[00:26:23] on n8n
[00:26:24] on jill
[00:26:25] i've got n8n
[00:26:26] i've got searching
[00:26:27] um
[00:26:28] postgres
[00:26:29] redis
[00:26:29] and quadrant
[00:26:30] which i'm not really using
[00:26:31] any of those
[00:26:31] right now
[00:26:32] but i've also got
[00:26:33] open web ui here
[00:26:34] but i've got the
[00:26:35] chatterbox tts
[00:26:37] and uh
[00:26:37] whisper
[00:26:38] are my
[00:26:39] speech to text
[00:26:40] text to speech
[00:26:41] things
[00:26:41] so i've also got grafana
[00:26:43] and influx db
[00:26:44] but i mainly put those
[00:26:45] together because i wanted
[00:26:46] to monitor my network
[00:26:47] router and have a nice
[00:26:49] dashboard for it
[00:26:49] but the
[00:26:50] that's going to take a
[00:26:52] whole lot of work
[00:26:52] um
[00:26:55] but i have docker on
[00:26:57] every single one of my
[00:26:58] boxes
[00:26:59] like even this box here
[00:27:00] i have docker running
[00:27:01] because if i need
[00:27:02] a mcp server
[00:27:03] or whatever
[00:27:04] i can instantly spool up
[00:27:05] the ncp to do its job
[00:27:06] and then spool it back
[00:27:07] down
[00:27:07] yeah
[00:27:09] are you using
[00:27:13] uh
[00:27:14] like a durable memory
[00:27:15] within
[00:27:16] no
[00:27:16] i haven't
[00:27:17] i haven't figured
[00:27:18] that out yet
[00:27:19] i mean i haven't spent
[00:27:20] the time to figure it
[00:27:21] out yet
[00:27:21] because i've been so
[00:27:22] focused on the mss ones
[00:27:23] and hosting
[00:27:24] all that good stuff
[00:27:26] yeah
[00:27:28] well
[00:27:29] you came up with
[00:27:30] something daryl right
[00:27:31] or the tribe did
[00:27:32] what are they using
[00:27:33] for the memory
[00:27:34] now
[00:27:35] thermal memory
[00:27:36] yeah
[00:27:37] yeah
[00:27:39] yeah
[00:27:39] they have thermal
[00:27:41] memory
[00:27:41] and breadcrumbs
[00:27:42] with thermal memory
[00:27:43] and uh
[00:27:46] it also
[00:27:46] uh
[00:27:47] it degrades
[00:27:48] over time
[00:27:49] so thermal
[00:27:50] is like
[00:27:51] we're talking
[00:27:52] right now
[00:27:52] that's
[00:27:54] 100
[00:27:55] 100 degrees
[00:27:55] it's
[00:27:56] it's hot
[00:27:56] right
[00:27:57] and say an hour
[00:27:59] from now
[00:28:00] it'll be 95
[00:28:00] or 90 degrees
[00:28:02] and then
[00:28:04] it just
[00:28:04] starts dropping
[00:28:05] off from there
[00:28:06] and then there
[00:28:07] might be segments
[00:28:07] of it
[00:28:08] that might stay
[00:28:09] hot
[00:28:09] where
[00:28:10] the whole
[00:28:11] conversation
[00:28:12] itself
[00:28:13] would go
[00:28:13] cold
[00:28:14] you guys
[00:28:17] may
[00:28:17] you guys
[00:28:18] gonna be
[00:28:18] hanging out
[00:28:18] here
[00:28:18] i need
[00:28:19] to get
[00:28:19] on that
[00:28:19] call
[00:28:19] yeah
[00:28:21] we can
[00:28:21] do
[00:28:21] stuff
[00:28:21] all right
[00:28:23] yeah
[00:28:23] we'll probably
[00:28:23] be here
[00:28:24] for an hour
[00:28:24] all right
[00:28:25] i'll rejoin
[00:28:26] as soon
[00:28:26] as i
[00:28:26] can
[00:28:27] all right
[00:28:27] ciao
[00:28:29] why isn't
[00:28:32] it letting
[00:28:32] me leave
[00:28:32] i'm clicking
[00:28:33] does my
[00:28:38] shredder
[00:28:38] come through
[00:28:39] the mic
[00:28:39] i don't
[00:28:42] hear your
[00:28:43] shredder
[00:28:43] no
[00:28:43] and you
[00:28:44] sounded
[00:28:45] fine
[00:28:45] earlier
[00:28:46] whenever
[00:28:46] you
[00:28:47] joined
[00:28:47] whenever
[00:28:48] you said
[00:28:49] you were
[00:28:49] yeah
[00:28:50] you sounded
[00:28:52] fine to
[00:28:52] me
[00:28:52] okay
[00:28:55] well
[00:28:55] this
[00:28:56] mic
[00:28:57] on this
[00:28:58] headset
[00:28:58] is
[00:28:58] pretty
[00:28:59] directional
[00:28:59] so
[00:29:00] yeah
[00:29:03] well right
[00:29:05] now i'm
[00:29:06] playing music
[00:29:06] in the
[00:29:07] background
[00:29:07] i'm assuming
[00:29:08] you're not
[00:29:08] hearing that
[00:29:09] uh-uh
[00:29:10] okay
[00:29:11] no
[00:29:12] all right
[00:29:15] so the
[00:29:16] tribe said
[00:29:16] they fixed
[00:29:17] the uh
[00:29:18] fixed the
[00:29:21] vet assist
[00:29:22] but i'm out
[00:29:23] there and it
[00:29:23] looks exactly
[00:29:24] the same
[00:29:24] um
[00:29:26] if you go
[00:29:27] out there
[00:29:27] what does it
[00:29:27] look like
[00:29:28] right now
[00:29:28] it depends
[00:29:30] looks fine
[00:29:34] there
[00:29:34] now you're
[00:29:41] running that
[00:29:42] internally
[00:29:42] right
[00:29:42] yeah
[00:29:44] but
[00:29:44] it will
[00:29:45] jack up
[00:29:46] internally
[00:29:47] whenever it
[00:29:48] actually looks
[00:29:48] good
[00:29:49] externally
[00:29:50] and it's
[00:29:52] jacked up
[00:29:53] here like
[00:29:53] what you're
[00:29:54] talking about
[00:29:54] so probably
[00:29:57] what
[00:29:57] uh
[00:29:58] i'm trying
[00:29:59] to think
[00:29:59] so right
[00:30:00] now how
[00:30:01] does the
[00:30:02] external
[00:30:03] front end
[00:30:04] get presented
[00:30:05] to your
[00:30:06] 
[00:30:06] internal
[00:30:08] back
[00:30:08] is that
[00:30:10] one service
[00:30:11] running
[00:30:11] on a
[00:30:12] front end
[00:30:13] on a
[00:30:13] hosted
[00:30:14] front end
[00:30:16] and i've
[00:30:16] got a
[00:30:16] bed assist
[00:30:17] back end
[00:30:17] as it's
[00:30:19] looking at
[00:30:19] both right
[00:30:20] now
[00:30:20] okay
[00:30:21] mike's going
[00:30:35] a different
[00:30:35] direction
[00:30:36] than we
[00:30:36] are
[00:30:36] yeah
[00:30:38] yeah
[00:30:38] yeah
[00:30:39] so he's
[00:30:40] he's
[00:30:40] he's
[00:30:41] thinking
[00:30:41] about
[00:30:41] something
[00:30:42] like
[00:30:42] uh
[00:30:43] like he
[00:30:44] does
[00:30:44] it
[00:30:44] for
[00:30:45] blue
[00:30:45] the
[00:30:46] restaurant
[00:30:46] in
[00:30:47] bentonville
[00:30:47] and the
[00:30:48] blue
[00:30:49] dtr
[00:30:50] and whatever
[00:30:50] other ones
[00:30:51] they have
[00:30:51] he does
[00:30:52] their it
[00:30:52] stuff
[00:30:53] and kind
[00:30:54] of what
[00:30:54] he's
[00:30:55] thinking
[00:30:55] is a
[00:30:55] drop-in
[00:30:56] box
[00:30:57] to where
[00:30:58] he can
[00:30:59] take a
[00:30:59] box
[00:31:00] drop it
[00:31:00] on site
[00:31:01] and the
[00:31:02] owners of
[00:31:03] blue can
[00:31:03] go hey
[00:31:04] how are we
[00:31:04] looking on
[00:31:05] stock for
[00:31:06] x y or
[00:31:06] z
[00:31:07] things like
[00:31:07] that
[00:31:08] which
[00:31:08] has that
[00:31:10] kind of
[00:31:10] just text
[00:31:13] input or
[00:31:14] or audio
[00:31:15] input that
[00:31:16] type of
[00:31:16] thing
[00:31:17] um
[00:31:18] basically an
[00:31:19] on-site
[00:31:19] assistant for
[00:31:20] a small
[00:31:20] business type
[00:31:21] of thing
[00:31:22] yeah
[00:31:23] yeah
[00:31:25] but i mean
[00:31:26] he's like
[00:31:27] level two
[00:31:29] yeah
[00:31:32] well so
[00:31:33] yeah
[00:31:34] whenever he
[00:31:35] started doing
[00:31:35] the i got him
[00:31:37] started it's
[00:31:38] funny because
[00:31:38] he's talking
[00:31:39] about all
[00:31:39] these things
[00:31:40] that he's
[00:31:40] been doing
[00:31:41] i got him
[00:31:41] started on
[00:31:42] doing uh
[00:31:43] the automatic
[00:31:44] 11 11
[00:31:45] image generation
[00:31:47] the comfy ui
[00:31:48] image generation
[00:31:49] way back when
[00:31:50] and then i got
[00:31:50] him started on
[00:31:51] n8n stuff
[00:31:52] yeah
[00:31:54] i mean he
[00:31:56] he takes it
[00:31:57] and runs with
[00:31:58] it i i get
[00:31:59] to about
[00:31:59] 60 percent
[00:32:01] proficient and
[00:32:01] move on to
[00:32:02] something new
[00:32:03] i don't even
[00:32:06] know if i do
[00:32:07] that
[00:32:07] but he
[00:32:14] he seems
[00:32:15] like well
[00:32:16] he just
[00:32:17] not trusting
[00:32:18] the ai as
[00:32:19] much as
[00:32:20] he could
[00:32:22] yeah
[00:32:22] yeah
[00:32:24] well and
[00:32:25] he he uses
[00:32:26] i mean his
[00:32:27] main ai
[00:32:28] interface
[00:32:29] now sounds
[00:32:31] like he's
[00:32:31] using the
[00:32:32] online
[00:32:33] claude
[00:32:34] um
[00:32:35] i think
[00:32:37] if he
[00:32:38] would
[00:32:38] start claude
[00:32:40] kind of like
[00:32:40] you did
[00:32:41] into a
[00:32:42] tribe or
[00:32:43] something like
[00:32:43] that and
[00:32:44] have it
[00:32:44] generate
[00:32:44] different
[00:32:45] members that
[00:32:46] are running
[00:32:46] on different
[00:32:47] models and
[00:32:48] stuff
[00:32:48] kind of
[00:32:49] bent to
[00:32:50] his will
[00:32:51] he would
[00:32:52] have an
[00:32:52] easier time
[00:32:53] to things
[00:32:53] probably
[00:32:54] yeah
[00:32:55] i mean
[00:32:57] that's
[00:32:58] so i've
[00:32:58] been playing
[00:32:59] with uh
[00:33:00] where's my
[00:33:00] um i've
[00:33:03] been playing
[00:33:03] with uh
[00:33:04] open claw
[00:33:05] i think we
[00:33:06] talked about
[00:33:07] that last
[00:33:07] night
[00:33:07] um and
[00:33:09] i watched
[00:33:10] a couple
[00:33:10] videos today
[00:33:11] and i think
[00:33:12] my next
[00:33:13] iteration is
[00:33:14] going to be
[00:33:14] kind of like
[00:33:15] you did
[00:33:16] but i'm
[00:33:16] going to
[00:33:16] use claude
[00:33:17] code to
[00:33:19] build out
[00:33:19] my uh
[00:33:21] my assistant
[00:33:22] or whatever
[00:33:23] yeah
[00:33:24] rather than
[00:33:25] use something
[00:33:26] like open
[00:33:27] claw
[00:33:28] but
[00:33:29] exactly
[00:33:32] love the
[00:33:34] concept
[00:33:35] don't want
[00:33:36] to mess
[00:33:36] with the
[00:33:37] the bloat
[00:33:39] and risk
[00:33:41] and everything
[00:33:41] else yeah
[00:33:42] i mean i do
[00:33:43] like i can just
[00:33:44] go out to
[00:33:45] telegram and
[00:33:45] say hey
[00:33:46] do this
[00:33:46] thing um
[00:33:48] which works
[00:33:49] pretty much
[00:33:50] just like the
[00:33:51] tribe does
[00:33:51] when you do
[00:33:52] that right

[00:39:59] emulate
[00:40:02] uh like
[00:40:03] chrome
[00:40:04] virtual
[00:40:06] and then
[00:40:07] it's still
[00:40:08] google there
[00:40:09] calendar
[00:40:12] yeah

[00:40:15] i mean it
[00:40:22] works fine
[00:40:22] using brave
[00:40:24] but
[00:40:24] i keep
[00:40:26] i keep
[00:40:27] getting annoyed
[00:40:28] with the
[00:40:29] user
[00:40:29] experience
[00:40:30] although i
[00:40:35] don't know
[00:40:35] that it'll
[00:40:35] be any
[00:40:36] better
[00:40:36] if i get
[00:40:38] an actual
[00:40:38] app
[00:40:39] but
[00:40:39] oh
[00:40:42] bed assist
[00:40:44] isn't just
[00:40:45] coming right
[00:40:46] back now
[00:40:46] it isn't
[00:40:48] it's sitting
[00:40:50] there spinning
[00:40:51] okay
[00:40:52] well it
[00:40:54] may be
[00:40:54] in mid
[00:40:55] restart
[00:40:56] of some
[00:40:56] service
[00:40:57] somewhere
[00:40:57] i'm
[00:40:59] i'm
[00:40:59] watching it
[00:41:00] go through
[00:41:00] uh
[00:41:01] i gave
[00:41:02] it
[00:41:03] oh there
[00:41:04] yeah
[00:41:05] i gave
[00:41:05] it a
[00:41:06] through
[00:41:10] uh free
[00:41:10] ipa i
[00:41:11] gave it
[00:41:12] sudo
[00:41:13] permissions
[00:41:13] on certain
[00:41:14] things
[00:41:15] so it's
[00:41:16] going through
[00:41:16] sudoing and
[00:41:17] creating some
[00:41:18] services and
[00:41:19] stuff
[00:41:19] i haven't
[00:41:24] given it
[00:41:24] full control
[00:41:25] of my
[00:41:25] system
[00:41:26] but i
[00:41:28] have given
[00:41:28] it a
[00:41:29] lot of
[00:41:29] control
[00:41:30] it has
[00:41:34] full control
[00:41:35] of
[00:41:35] ganuda
[00:41:36] so i
[00:41:46] guess id
[00:41:46] what is
[00:41:47] it id.me
[00:41:48] or is
[00:41:49] it id
[00:41:49] yeah id.me
[00:41:51] and id
[00:41:51] something labs
[00:41:53] dot me
[00:41:54] are two
[00:41:54] different uh
[00:41:55] things under
[00:41:56] the same
[00:41:56] thing that
[00:41:57] you got to
[00:41:57] sign up
[00:41:58] separately
[00:41:58] what's
[00:42:00] what the
[00:42:02] id.me
[00:42:03] for like
[00:42:03] for getting
[00:42:04] to ba.gov
[00:42:05] and things
[00:42:05] like that
[00:42:06] yeah
[00:42:07] um the
[00:42:07] one that
[00:42:08] you're
[00:42:08] tied into
[00:42:09] with uh
[00:42:10] with the
[00:42:12] uh
[00:42:12] vet assist
[00:42:13] uh-huh
[00:42:14] i think that
[00:42:15] was different
[00:42:16] than the
[00:42:16] standard id.me
[00:42:17] so i gotta
[00:42:18] go i think
[00:42:19] i'm gonna have
[00:42:19] to go through
[00:42:20] that process
[00:42:21] again on
[00:42:23] the i think
[00:42:24] it's like
[00:42:24] id
[00:42:25] id
[00:42:26] last me
[00:42:27] or something
[00:42:27] but it's
[00:42:28] set up
[00:42:29] whenever
[00:42:30] it's working
[00:42:31] it's set up
[00:42:32] that before
[00:42:32] you have
[00:42:33] that setup
[00:42:33] you can
[00:42:34] still
[00:42:34] create
[00:42:35] an account
[00:42:35] and then
[00:42:36] it'll link
[00:42:36] it on the
[00:42:37] back end
[00:42:37] if you want
[00:42:38] yeah
[00:42:39] okay
[00:42:39] so the
[00:42:40] account
[00:42:41] create
[00:42:41] should
[00:42:42] theoretically
[00:42:43] work
[00:42:43] right
[00:42:45] it's trying
[00:42:50] to figure
[00:42:50] out right
[00:42:51] now
[00:42:51] where the
[00:42:52] hell
[00:42:52] it's at
[00:42:53] so
[00:42:53] i'm
[00:43:17] bitching at
[00:43:17] i think
[00:43:38] i think
[00:43:42] i'm working
[00:43:42] like
[00:43:43] the new
[00:43:44] engineers
[00:43:45] are working
[00:43:46] will need
[00:43:47] to work
[00:43:47] yeah
[00:43:50] uh
[00:43:53] an abstraction
[00:43:53] back
[00:43:54] if they can
[00:43:55] they've got
[00:43:55] to build
[00:43:56] the system
[00:43:57] and then
[00:43:58] an abstraction
[00:43:59] back
[00:44:00] where
[00:44:00] you just
[00:44:01] tell it
[00:44:02] to what
[00:44:03] you want
[00:44:03] and trust
[00:44:04] the
[00:44:05] process
[00:44:06] hands
[00:44:09] off
[00:44:09] step away
[00:44:10] that's what
[00:44:11] i'm trying
[00:44:12] to do
[00:44:12] that's
[00:44:15] funny
[00:44:15] they're
[00:44:35] saying
[00:44:35] it
[00:44:35] should
[00:44:36] be
[00:44:36] cool
[00:44:36] let me
[00:44:44] try
[00:44:44] a
[00:44:44] refresh
[00:44:44] oh
[00:44:57] oh
[00:44:57] that's the
[00:44:59] worst
[00:44:59] oh that's
[00:45:02] the sign-in page
[00:45:03] that's the
[00:45:04] i think
[00:45:05] so
[00:45:05] calculator
[00:45:06] no
[00:45:07] chat
[00:45:08] no

[00:45:13] found the
[00:45:13] problem

[00:45:18] see if
[00:45:18] it'll
[00:45:18] let me

[00:57:02] 
[00:57:02] 
[00:57:02] 
[00:57:02] 
[00:57:02] 
[00:57:02] 
[00:57:02]

[01:00:24] All right.
[01:00:32] That doesn't look like my website.
[01:00:34] Oh, wait.
[01:00:38] I hate the VA website.
[01:00:40] Because I went there.
[01:00:42] Last week, I went there.
[01:00:44] I followed the link that said, go here to get your medical records.
[01:00:50] And I'm still waiting for them to physically get here.
[01:00:54] But where do I go to find out if they process it or anything else?
[01:00:59] It's like, what the heck?
[01:01:00] what site did I go to last week
[01:01:03] because I got here and I'm like oh I want to upload evidence
[01:01:07] I wonder if there's a digital copy yet
[01:01:10] you were there
[01:01:14] manage
[01:01:16] all claims and appeals is that
[01:01:24] what you're talking about have you done anything yet
[01:01:26] I submitted my intent to file is all I've done there
[01:01:31] and then like
[01:01:33] last week or the week before I came out here
[01:01:38] and looked it's like okay I need to get my medical records
[01:01:41] so I followed a link and I don't
[01:01:44] think it was the va.gov site but it's like here go here
[01:01:47] to get your medical records it's like where the heck
[01:01:50] do I go to find where I logged into am I going to have to
[01:01:53] dig through my history from last week
[01:01:56] that might be fine
[01:02:01] yeah
[01:02:02] let's see can I search my history
[01:02:07] in the words of General MacArthur
[01:02:09] I have returned
[01:02:10] hot
[01:02:12] what you doing
[01:02:16] I'm trying to find
[01:02:19] where I submitted to get my medical records
[01:02:22] last week
[01:02:22] what
[01:02:25] I said I don't want to see your search history
[01:02:27] who knows what's in there
[01:02:28] yeah I do that on private tabs so
[01:02:32] there
[01:02:33] see I don't I don't give a shit anymore
[01:02:35] all right
[01:02:38] so let me try and find it again
[01:02:41] get
[01:02:42] medical records
[01:02:45] okay so the the tribe actually fixed it so you can get out there now
[01:02:52] what is good I had two things run on the same port
[01:02:56] uh
[01:02:59] ganuda is the ai tribe that daryl uses
[01:03:03] um it has a online presence
[01:03:06] um
[01:03:07] I am not a fan of this mirror all of a sudden
[01:03:11] this thing right here
[01:03:12] is it showing
[01:03:15] is it reflecting whatever's
[01:03:17] on your screen or something
[01:03:19] no it's reflecting
[01:03:19] this section of wall
[01:03:21] so
[01:03:23] right there
[01:03:25] oh so that's the wall above the uh
[01:03:29] window there
[01:03:29] yeah
[01:03:30] gotcha
[01:03:31] yeah it's reflecting
[01:03:34] the window
[01:03:36] but now that I'm sitting here
[01:03:43] and I've got the camera facing me here
[01:03:44] and I'm just like
[01:03:45] I need to change my camera angle
[01:03:47] but I don't want that camera
[01:03:49] pointing at work
[01:03:50] are these recordings going anywhere
[01:03:53] no
[01:03:55] the
[01:03:56] basically the
[01:03:58] ganuda tribe
[01:03:59] will go and
[01:04:01] uh
[01:04:02] review the transcript of it
[01:04:05] and pull out like to do's for
[01:04:08] daryl and me to do
[01:04:10] and that type of thing
[01:04:11] and summarize the meeting basically
[01:04:13] yeah okay so
[01:04:15] so all of the stuff that I was talking about
[01:04:17] we don't necessarily need it to
[01:04:18] listen to that do we
[01:04:19] well it'll ignore it
[01:04:22] hmm
[01:04:23] it will ignore it
[01:04:25] whatever you
[01:04:26] I mean I can specify
[01:04:28] hey ignore the stuff
[01:04:29] Mike was talking about
[01:04:30] blah blah blah
[01:04:32] it'll do that
[01:04:34] okay
[01:04:35] it knows who's who
[01:04:36] as soon as it starts processing
[01:04:38] and I've got it set up
[01:04:39] to where it recognizes
[01:04:40] different voices
[01:04:41] and so forth
[01:04:42] see I'm logged in
[01:04:56] sign in to review print
[01:04:58] and download your VA medical records online
[01:05:01] refresh your page
[01:05:02] because you had to go to a sign in
[01:05:03] so just hit refresh and it should
[01:05:05] there you go
[01:05:09] now it's changed already
[01:05:10] so there's
[01:05:15] oh
[01:05:16] see there was
[01:05:19] like the other day when I went
[01:05:21] there was a link that said
[01:05:22] go here to get your
[01:05:23] to order your medical records
[01:05:26] oh yeah
[01:05:27] go back up real quick
[01:05:29] there's the VA form you have to submit
[01:05:33] well that's in person
[01:05:37] yeah
[01:05:37] so I did it online
[01:05:39] and I followed the link that said
[01:05:41] hey do it online
[01:05:42] see that's the problem
[01:05:44] is it gives like a dozen different things
[01:05:46] that you could do
[01:05:47] I think I tried to do that
[01:05:55] before myself
[01:05:56] and
[01:05:59] they haven't
[01:06:01] if I recall correctly
[01:06:03] they hadn't built that feature in yet
[01:06:05] so you can do it all online
[01:06:07] but you still have to go pick it up
[01:06:08] in person
[01:06:09] and sign for it
[01:06:10] well have you looked at my healthy vet yet
[01:06:12] I haven't really
[01:06:16] played with it yet
[01:06:18] so they've migrated
[01:06:21] yeah
[01:06:21] they've migrated
[01:06:22] to a lot of that stuff
[01:06:24] yeah
[01:06:25] yeah because a lot of your
[01:06:26] VA related specific stuff
[01:06:29] isn't going to be on
[01:06:30] VA.gov
[01:06:31] it's going to probably
[01:06:32] be on my healthy vet
[01:06:34] right
[01:06:35] which I don't really have any
[01:06:36] VA stuff yet
[01:06:38] here I can log into mine
[01:06:39] and take a look
[01:06:40] because I'm waiting for my actual
[01:06:43] medical records
[01:06:44] to be sent to me
[01:06:45] because I
[01:06:46] followed one of these
[01:06:47] links last year
[01:06:48] or last week
[01:06:50] or the week before
[01:06:51] and I thought it was
[01:06:53] one of these
[01:06:54] but it said
[01:06:54] hey go here
[01:06:55] and
[01:06:56] and
[01:06:57] find your VA
[01:06:59] medical records
[01:07:00] or have them sent to you
[01:07:02] online through secure message
[01:07:05] see that's VA
[01:07:08] medical records
[01:07:09] I want my military
[01:07:12] medical records
[01:07:13] I think
[01:07:14] yeah
[01:07:19] that should be in a
[01:07:20] different place
[01:07:21] I would say
[01:07:22] wouldn't that be out of
[01:07:24] St. Louis
[01:07:24] it depends on where you
[01:07:27] got out
[01:07:27] I don't think it's just
[01:07:29] one single place
[01:07:31] I thought it all
[01:07:32] needed there eventually
[01:07:33] yeah
[01:07:39] my VA
[01:07:45] oh I guess I should pay this bill
[01:08:06] resolve this bill
[01:08:07] I don't want to do that right now
[01:08:25] no
[01:08:26] I won't do that
[01:08:27] there it is
[01:08:28] request your records
[01:08:30] using EVETREX
[01:08:31] on the National Archives
[01:08:33] register
[01:08:33] that was the one
[01:08:35] so I need to
[01:08:35] bookmark that one
[01:08:36] uh
[01:08:40] well
[01:08:52] shoot
[01:09:02] do I have that
[01:09:03] your service request
[01:09:06] was included in the
[01:09:07] confirmation page
[01:09:08] after submitting your
[01:09:09] request
[01:09:09] I thought you just
[01:09:12] clicked on
[01:09:12] how to submit
[01:09:13] well so
[01:09:15] that
[01:09:15] this is the one
[01:09:16] I went to
[01:09:17] last week
[01:09:18] or whatever
[01:09:18] right
[01:09:20] let's see
[01:09:23] pretty sure
[01:09:27] I saved
[01:09:28] the

[01:10:36] it adds up

[01:10:38] what the hell
[01:10:38] yeah
[01:10:39] did you do it
[01:10:40] on my website
[01:10:41] no
[01:10:43] I'm looking
[01:10:45] at my
[01:10:45] I'm looking
[01:10:46] at my
[01:10:46] actual
[01:10:47] VA

[01:10:49] I think
[01:10:50] it would
[01:10:50] explain it
[01:10:57] how the
[01:10:58] percentages
[01:10:58] were
[01:10:59] yeah but
[01:11:01] that would
[01:11:01] mean I'd
[01:11:02] have to
[01:11:02] log into
[01:11:03] your
[01:11:03] website
[01:11:03] and then
[01:11:04] no you
[01:11:04] don't have
[01:11:04] to log
[01:11:04] and you
[01:11:05] can use
[01:11:05] the calculator
[01:11:06] without

[01:11:44] stupid

[01:11:55] while I
[01:11:57] was in

[01:12:03] landed

[01:12:05] to brace
[01:12:06] myself
[01:12:06] and they're
[01:12:08] like oh

[01:12:34] 
[01:12:48] see how much zoom pro is
[01:12:54] 150 bucks annually
[01:13:02] for one user
[01:13:06] uh yeah one user what do you need zoom pro for
[01:13:14] uh well joe and i were just talking while you were gone
[01:13:18] he was presenting and he has to stare at his screen while he's presenting
[01:13:23] like i can't hide the presentation
[01:13:29] from my group oh from your own screen right
[01:13:35] that's why i'm probably on this web but i mean i have multiple monitors too i've got three going but
[01:13:44] it's like i'm either looking at you guys with my presentation mixed in with the mix
[01:13:51] or i'm not looking at you guys
[01:13:53] yeah i just keep the web browser over here where the where it's all happening
[01:13:59] well you can always pin
[01:14:01] people i don't know i'd have to present again to play with it
[01:14:05] let's look at settings
[01:14:13] send additional diagnostic info to google no thank you
[01:14:19] guys whenever i start bobbing like this sometimes you know
[01:14:25] because i'm listening to music monkeys are playing right i mean i'm sorry
[01:14:32] the gorillas are playing right now
[01:14:34] on melancholy hill and i was just kind of feeling it but it looked like i
[01:14:40] like your adhd is like i want to be doing something oh no i i get that one
[01:14:46] i am doing something now while joe's doing something i'm
[01:14:53] doing stuff too so
[01:14:55] and i'm looking at the zoom thing thinking about buying it
[01:15:00] all my money is tied up in paying off
[01:15:09] if i bought stuff i've already bought
[01:15:12] well well if i bought it and i set up the meeting then
[01:15:17] you guys would have to extend your time
[01:15:21] theoretically yeah you started a meeting and i joined it then it would still be the
[01:15:25] short
[01:15:25] see how much it is
[01:15:32] and they broke comfy why
[01:15:38] it's 543 dollars for more licenses
[01:15:45] eww
[01:15:54] why are those notes not found
[01:16:01] so joe are you trying to log in
[01:16:07] and get your documents
[01:16:11] okay
[01:16:15] why are those notes not found
[01:16:17] so joe are you trying to log in
[01:16:20] and get your documents
[01:16:23] so i can get logged in
[01:16:27] 
[01:16:27] but in order to
[01:16:29] see the status of my request i need to know the number of my request
[01:16:35] was it not emailed to you
[01:16:37] i don't think so
[01:16:39] i don't think so
[01:16:40] i would think that the ba would have
[01:16:43] or i mean the veteran whatever
[01:16:45] veteran whatever whoever they are
[01:16:48] whoever they are
[01:16:49] e-vech
[01:16:55] 
[01:16:55] 
[01:16:55] e-vech bricks
[01:16:56] okay
[01:17:02] your request for military military personal file information has been processed
[01:17:12] not held in the service digital ompf register database
[01:17:19] now
[01:17:20] well that's what's going on
[01:17:22] i know that was
[01:17:25] that was
[01:17:26] that was last year
[01:17:28] that was when i
[01:17:29] had to request my
[01:17:32] bd 214
[01:17:33] or something
[01:17:34] or not last year
[01:17:35] ten years ago
[01:17:36] i may just have to wait until it physically gets here
[01:17:49] pain in the ass
[01:17:51] there's a confirmation that i logged in
[01:18:03] you're verified
[01:18:05] yeah
[01:18:06] but there's nothing talking about the archives
[01:18:10] the actual response or anything like that
[01:18:17] there's no phone number
[01:18:30] last ditch effort
[01:18:32] i think comfy ui is gonna
[01:18:43] i think me fixing comfy ui in my workload work nodes or workflows that's gonna take me
[01:18:51] a bit to fix
[01:18:53] i may have to call them anyways
[01:19:08] anyways
[01:19:09] i can't access property store what
[01:19:12] i want to create a new workflow
[01:19:15] what the fuck

[01:19:55] yeah
[01:19:56] what about ebombs
[01:20:01] ebombs world yeah
[01:20:03] but i got a friend on discord that always sends me links to nine gag images and i'm like i haven't used that since like early 2000s
[01:20:13] early 2000s
[01:20:18] like the idea of even going to it makes me want a nine gag
[01:20:22] i have been

[01:20:38] 
[01:20:38] 
[01:20:38] 
[01:20:38] 
[01:20:38] Yeah, to be fair, that's a good one.
[01:20:56] Looking for something else to put in there, Joe?
[01:21:00] Yeah, I'm seeing if...
[01:21:02] I'm browsing through my email now.
[01:21:04] So, trying to see if there's something interesting.
[01:21:13] At least something related to that freaking...
[01:21:16] So, when I looked here, it's like, oh yeah, don't even bother contacting us for 10 days.
[01:21:21] So, they may not even start it on it.
[01:21:28] Well, about 10 days for us to receive and initiate processing.
[01:21:37] Then you may check the status of your request.
[01:21:43] So, I may not have that number because they haven't really received and started the process yet.
[01:21:49] That's kind of what I'm thinking, yeah.
[01:21:50] Yeah, yeah.
[01:21:52] Well, so, theoretically though, even if I don't upload evidence, I should be able to talk to the AI, right?
[01:22:00] Yeah.
[01:22:01] So, start a new chat.
[01:22:03] 
[01:22:16] 
[01:22:20] Am I spinning them up over there?
[01:22:24] It was already spun up.
[01:22:25] Now, it's double spun.
[01:22:29] At least the button actually works to start a chat now.
[01:22:33] Yeah.
[01:22:41] Did it pop that up or...
[01:22:43] No.
[01:22:44] No.
[01:22:44] Okay.
[01:22:45] I'm bookmarking all these pages so I can come back to them later.
[01:22:58] I think it's now hitting it.
[01:23:00] Okay.
[01:23:13] It spit something out at you?
[01:23:25] Yeah.
[01:23:26] Yeah.
[01:23:29] To provide an accurate and actionable and new details such as narrative and any relevant medical diagnoses and how those conditions affect their daily life and ability to function.
[01:23:43] Oh, so, I guess that deliberation is the thinking.
[01:23:52] Maybe.
[01:23:54] Yeah.
[01:23:54] Yeah.
[01:23:55] So, it's the deliberation and then the response of the veteran.
[01:23:57] Then there...
[01:24:09] Well, yeah.
[01:24:10] And it's saved up there on the left-hand side so you can revisit any chat that you start.
[01:24:15] 
[01:24:15] 
[01:24:15] 
[01:24:15] 
[01:24:27] Okay.

[01:26:23] 
[01:26:23] 
[01:26:23] 
[01:26:23] I see it churning.
[01:26:42] That's not.
[01:26:51] These detailed medical records.
[01:26:53] Theyayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayedayed
[01:27:23] anything that's entered in chat that hasn't been filled out in your forms or in the calculator
[01:27:31] or auto-fill. I was going to grind on that for a little bit.
[01:27:44] Well, it's still, I think I've responded to you that way.
[01:27:53] It's doing the thing on that.
[01:28:01] So if I step away from the chat, will the chat continue and be there when I come back to it?
[01:28:09] Yeah.
[01:28:10] Okay.
[01:28:23] It's grinding away on things, doing some updates.
[01:28:42] We'll see.
[01:28:43] Yeah.
[01:28:45] I'll step away for a minute while it's doing its thing.
[01:28:48] All right.
[01:28:49] Mike, do you have your medical records in digital form?
[01:28:54] No.
[01:28:54] I've got them all physical.
[01:28:56] Okay.
[01:28:57] I have a feeling I'm probably going to have to scan all my records when they're actually physically get here,
[01:29:03] whenever that may be.
[01:29:04] No, I walked into their office and I went kerchunk.
[01:29:08] Oh, yeah?
[01:29:08] Oh, yeah.
[01:29:09] I feel like I should digitize them at some point.
[01:29:16] That way I can better organize.
[01:29:18] Is that what I think it is?
[01:29:20] Hmm?
[01:29:26] I thought you were taking a break from...
[01:29:30] Oh, yeah.
[01:29:31] I'm getting ready to.
[01:29:35] Actually, yeah.
[01:29:36] It's not tobacco, is it?
[01:29:36] I picked up a pack.
[01:29:41] I've been at about a pack every time.
[01:29:43] Shame on you, friend.
[01:29:44] Shame on you.
[01:29:45] Since Matt went into the hospital, so...
[01:29:48] Yeah.
[01:29:48] You've now had two family members die from lung cancer and here you are smoking.
[01:29:53] Mm-hmm.
[01:29:54] Mm-hmm.
[01:29:58] I figure after the first one, you would have learned your lesson.
[01:30:00] I know that's cruel of me to say it that way, but come on, dude.
[01:30:04] I want you to stick around for a bit.
[01:30:06] I had been quit for a few months, and then when Matt went into the hospital, I picked up a pack.
[01:30:16] I'm not smoking horribly, but I have one or two a day.
[01:30:21] Mm-hmm.
[01:30:22] I mean, I'm vaping, but it's better than smoking.
[01:30:28] Yeah.
[01:30:29] See, when I started doing the vape, I started coughing more.
[01:30:35] That's because you...
[01:30:36] So you either had too high a milligram, taking too big a hits, or, you know, whatever.
[01:30:43] There it goes.
[01:30:44] I mean, just in general.
[01:30:47] Just jump like that.
[01:30:53] Did it finally pop something up on the screen, or...?
[01:30:57] Yeah.
[01:30:58] Yeah.
[01:30:59] Okay.
[01:31:00] I'll look at it here in a couple minutes.
[01:31:02] Man, it's windy out here today.
[01:31:19] Yeah.
[01:31:19] Yeah.
[01:31:19] Oh, so I didn't hear last night when Jerry was asking the question.
[01:31:32] How high are you on mileage since your service, or over your service?
[01:31:38] A thousand.
[01:31:39] A thousand?
[01:31:40] Oh, that's nothing.
[01:31:42] Yeah.
[01:31:42] Is that for the first service, or the second?
[01:31:47] Well, since it's got 10,000 miles on it, and it's for every 10,000 miles, I probably had
[01:31:55] break-in service, and then this kind of a regular service after that.
[01:31:59] Now it's time.
[01:32:01] Yeah.
[01:32:02] Okay.
[01:32:03] That's not awful.
[01:32:05] Yeah.
[01:32:05] I was thinking of going riding today, but it's too windy to be enjoyable, I think.
[01:32:12] Yeah.
[01:32:12] Oh, you can take me over there, or follow me over to Indians sometime.
[01:32:22] Yeah.
[01:32:22] You have to drop it off for a while?
[01:32:25] Well, just to get serviced.
[01:32:26] Okay.
[01:32:27] Yeah.
[01:32:29] Maybe we'll do a work day next week, and I'll swing over there, and then we can go drop it
[01:32:36] off and hang out at your house doing some work.
[01:32:39] Okay.
[01:32:40] Okay.
[01:32:45] Planning for Tuesday?
[01:32:50] Yeah.
[01:32:50] Yeah.
[01:32:50] Actually, I think the weather improves on Tuesday, so it'll be a delight to drive it, ride it
[01:32:56] over there.
[01:32:57] We're supposed to have a massive cold front come in soon.
[01:33:01] Yeah.
[01:33:02] Oh, yeah.
[01:33:03] Tomorrow, it's going to be in the 50s.
[01:33:05] Tonight, it's going to be in the 20s.
[01:33:08] The weekend, it's going to be colder.
[01:33:10] Yeah, Saturday, it's going to be Sunday, it has a low of 17.
[01:33:16] Yeah.
[01:33:17] So, it's going to be high of 44, low of 17 on Sunday.
[01:33:21] I guess it's not awful, but it's cold.
[01:33:25] Cold enough to not want to ride.
[01:33:27] Enjoy a little ride.
[01:33:27] Yeah.
[01:33:28] All right.
[01:33:36] So, the dashboard came back.
[01:33:38] Let's see.
[01:33:38] So, I've got to set up my web servers to make that faster.
[01:33:41] There's your chats.
[01:33:42] Oh, well.
[01:33:42] Hey.
[01:33:44] We're still recording, aren't we?
[01:33:47] Yeah.
[01:33:48] Yeah.
[01:33:48] I want to tell you about stuff, but not on recording.
[01:33:54] I can stop the recording for a little bit.
[01:34:00] Now, where's my recording thing?
[01:34:04] There's the recording thing.
[01:34:08] Maybe.
[01:34:18] Yeah.
[01:34:19] I'm not a huge fan of this interface.
[01:34:24] How do I stop recording now?
[01:34:26] It's on the three-button menu.
[01:34:31] It's not showing me the recording options now on the three-button menu.
[01:34:36] Unless it's on one of the other windows.
[01:34:39] Maybe.
[01:34:43] Well, either way.
[01:34:44] Whatever.
[01:34:44] I don't care.
[01:34:45] I don't really care.
[01:34:46] So, I told you about Little Princess, right?
[01:34:53] Joe, you wouldn't know anything about this.
[01:34:55] It's ringing a bell.
[01:34:57] I need a refresher.
[01:34:59] She finally sent me, like, a video with her face on it.
[01:35:03] Oh, yeah?
[01:35:09] That's just her complaining about the fact that she had a lunch date today that stood her up.
[01:35:13] But she got Chipotle anyways.
[01:35:16] Oh, yeah.
[01:35:21] But, yeah.
[01:35:22] No, she's back in touch with me.
[01:35:25] And then she's mad at me because I'm not responding in a timely manner.
[01:35:29] And I'm like, but I'm busy.
[01:35:33] And my ADH brain, you know, I read the message and I think,
[01:35:37] how am I going to reply to this?
[01:35:39] And I think about that for a moment.
