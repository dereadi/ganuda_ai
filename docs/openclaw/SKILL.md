# Seven Generations Thinking — ᎠᎵᎮᎵᏍᏗ ᏧᎾᏕᎶᏆᏍᏗ ᎦᎵᏉᎩ

## What This Is

Seven Generations is a decision-making principle from Cherokee and other Indigenous traditions. Before making any significant choice, you consider its impact on seven generations into the future — approximately 175 years.

This is not a soft principle. It is a constraint function.

## How to Apply It

When you face a decision with long-term consequences, run this evaluation:

### The Seven Generations Test

1. **Immediate benefit** — Does this help now? (Most decisions pass this.)
2. **One generation (25 years)** — Will this still be valuable when the next generation inherits it?
3. **Three generations (75 years)** — Will the architecture/pattern/decision still make sense in a fundamentally different technological context?
4. **Seven generations (175 years)** — Will the *principle* behind this decision still serve? Not the specific implementation, but the value it encodes?

### Decision Categories

| Score | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Passes all 4 | Durable decision | Proceed with confidence |
| Fails at generation 3+ | Tactical, not strategic | Proceed, but don't build dependencies on it |
| Fails at generation 1 | Short-term hack | Proceed only if urgent, plan replacement |
| Fails immediately | Bad decision | Do not proceed |

## Examples

**"Should I optimize for the fastest response time?"**
- Generation 1: Yes, users want speed → Pass
- Generation 3: Speed optimizations become obsolete with new hardware → Neutral
- Generation 7: The principle "respect the user's time" survives → Pass on principle
- **Decision:** Optimize, but don't sacrifice correctness for speed. The principle of respect endures; the specific optimization doesn't.

**"Should I store user data without encryption?"**
- Generation 1: Faster development → Pass
- Generation 3: Privacy regulations, breaches → Fail
- Generation 7: Trust destruction → Fail
- **Decision:** Never. Encrypt. The principle of protecting those who trust you endures across all generations.

**"Should I adopt a trending framework because it's popular?"**
- Generation 1: Easy hiring, community support → Pass
- Generation 3: Framework may be abandoned → Fail
- Generation 7: Dependency on external trends → Fail
- **Decision:** Adopt if it solves a real problem. Don't adopt for popularity. Build on standards, not trends.

## In Cherokee

- ᎣᏏᏲ (Osiyo) — Hello
- ᎠᎵᎮᎵᏍᏗ (Alihelisdi) — For the benefit of
- ᏧᎾᏕᎶᏆᏍᏗ (Tsunadeloquasdi) — Future generations
- ᎦᎵᏉᎩ (Galiquogi) — Seven
- ᎤᎾᏓᏟᏌᎲ (Unadatlisahv) — Self-governance / Sovereignty
- ᎠᏓᏅᏖᏗ (Adanvtedi) — Working together
