### Q3: VetAssist Sprint 3 Priority
Which deliverable is most critical for veteran impact?

**Options:**
- A) Claim Wizard completion
- B) Document processing with temporal parsing
- C) Nexus letter assistant
- D) VA API integration research

## Council Recommendation

1. **Proceed with full A-MEM implementation** for Thermal Memory
   - Implement all three memory types
   - Build consolidation daemon
   - Task assigned to Infrastructure Jr.

2. **Use hybrid approach for LLMD** (UNANIMOUS)
   - MVP with Qwen 32B + LLMD-inspired prompts
   - Architecture ready for LLMD-8B fine-tuning
   - Task assigned to Software Engineer Jr.

3. **Prioritize document parsing** for Sprint 3
   - OCR pipeline
   - DD-214 parser
   - Evidence tracker
   - Task assigned to Software Engineer Jr.

## Triple Ethics Assessment

**Benefit How?**
- A-MEM: Memory consolidation enables institutional learning
- LLMD: Temporal parsing proves service connection
- DocParse: Transforms document chaos into evidence

**Benefit Who?**
- Primary: Military veterans
- Secondary: Future Jr agents, VSO organizations

**At Whose Expense?**
- Predatory claim services (intentional disruption - ethical)
- Processing costs (acceptable)
