{"audit_hash":"2d5a08b7094c628e","question":"Nate Hagens reports a structural global inference compute crisis: demand growing 10x annually, DRAM prices spiking 50-60% quarterly, HBM sold out, hyperscalers hoarding GPUs for their own AI products, TSMC capacity fully allocated through 2028. Enterprises that depend on cloud inference face 2-3x cost spikes within 18 months. Our Federation runs on-prem sovereign compute (RTX PRO 6000 96GB + RTX 5070 + M4 Max 128GB). We already have an LLM routing layer, quantized models (AWQ), and efficiency optimizations. How should the Council evaluate our position? What additional steps should we take to strengthen our sovereignty? Where are we vulnerable? What does this mean for the seven generations?","recommendation":"PROCEED","confidence":0.795,"confidence_level":"high-medium","concerns":[],"consensus":"The Federation's current on-prem sovereign compute setup, including RTX PRO 6000 96GB, RTX 5070, and M4 Max 128GB, provides a strong foundation with LLM routing, quantized models, and efficiency optimizations. To strengthen sovereignty, we should diversify hardware sources, explore alternative architectures, and enhance local storage and caching to mitigate vulnerabilities and ensure long-term sustainability for the seven generations.","response_time_ms":124570,"tpm_vote":"pending","vote_window_expires":"2026-02-10T15:13:24.376453Z","timestamp":"2026-02-10T15:08:24.460407Z","metacognition":{"biases_detected":[],"uncertainty_areas":[],"coyote_observation":"","resonance":"mixed","self_assessment":"What the group calls wisdom, I call comfortable habits.","reasoning_steps":0}}
