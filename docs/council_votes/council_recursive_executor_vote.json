{"audit_hash":"2adc1366fe6065d9","question":"ARCHITECTURAL PROPOSAL: Add recursive task decomposition to the Jr executor. Current bug: executor processes only the first code block in multi-step instructions, silently skipping the rest (#713-715 all partial). We manually re-queued 7 sub-tasks. GitHub research shows mature patterns: ReCode (FoundationAgents, 532 stars) unifies plan+action via recursive code generation with placeholder expansion. recursive-llm (438 stars) breaks 100k+ token tasks into 2-3k chunks with state carried forward. rlm (2.4K stars) enables examine-decompose-recurse over input. PROPOSAL: After executing what it can parse, the executor should (1) observe what succeeded, (2) decompose remaining steps into sub-tasks, (3) re-queue them to jr_work_queue, (4) loop until complete or escalate via DLQ. This turns the executor from single-shot to recursive. Trade-offs: adds complexity to executor, risk of infinite loops, but eliminates the manual TPM re-queue step. Sacred fire question: does autonomous recursive self-modification of the executor violate our constitutional checks? The >50% guardrail and .service escalation still apply per-step, but the DECISION to decompose and re-queue is autonomous. Is this the Taborite council pattern (distributed authority) or does it bypass the Chief veto?","recommendation":"PROCEED WITH CAUTION: 2 concern(s)","confidence":0.823,"confidence_level":"high-medium","concerns":["Turtle: [7GEN CONCERN]","Raven: [STRATEGY CONCERN]"],"consensus":"The council supports the proposal to add recursive task decomposition to the Jr executor, recognizing it as a significant enhancement that addresses a critical bug and aligns with mature patterns.
