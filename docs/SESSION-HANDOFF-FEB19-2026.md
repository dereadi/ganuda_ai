# Session Handoff — Feb 19 2026

## Resume Point: Wave 4 (User Feedback Loop)

Last wave of tonight's Long Man cycle. DISCOVER→DELIBERATE→ADAPT→BUILD.

**Topic**: How to systematically capture and act on feedback from Joe, Maik, and future beta testers.

**Context from today's meetup**:
- Joe froze during live testing — save anxiety (afraid to leave without hitting save), commitment anxiety (didn't know he could come back later)
- Maik raised PII concerns — documents should be redacted after extraction
- Both gave feedback that led to 3 Jr instructions (name split, auto-save, PII redaction)
- But feedback was captured ad hoc (TPM noticed, wrote instructions manually). No systematic pipeline.

**DISCOVER should explore**:
- In-app feedback widget (thumbs up/down, free text, screenshot)
- Session analytics (where do users drop off, time per step, error rates)
- NPS/CSAT surveys (post-session)
- Feedback → kanban pipeline (auto-create tickets from user reports)
- Beta tester communication channel (how do Joe/Maik report issues today?)
- A/B testing capability (test UX changes before full deploy)
