# VLM Data Sovereignty Protocol
Cherokee AI Federation - Seven Generations Principle

## Core Principles

### 1. Data Remains on Tribal Infrastructure
- All camera frames processed ONLY on tribal-owned servers (redfin, sasass)
- NO cloud APIs (OpenAI, Google, etc.) for vision processing
- NO external model training on tribal visual data

### 2. Tribal Control
- VLM models run locally with full source code access
- All inference logs owned by federation
- Right to delete any visual data at any time

### 3. Cultural Sensitivity
- VLM descriptions reviewed for cultural appropriateness
- Traditional knowledge NOT fed to VLM training
- Sacred sites/ceremonies excluded from VLM processing

## Sustainability Assessment

### Energy Consumption
- Estimated VLM power draw: 300W during inference
- Daily operation estimate: 8 hours active = 2.4 kWh
- Monthly estimate: 72 kWh
- Carbon offset: Consider solar expansion on facility

### Hardware Lifecycle
- GPU expected lifespan: 5-7 years
- Plan for responsible e-waste disposal
- Prefer upgradable/repairable hardware

## Knowledge Preservation

### Integration with Traditional Wisdom
- VLM enhances but does not replace human observation
- Elders retain final authority on security decisions
- Document how VLM complements traditional practices

### Training Documentation
- All VLM capabilities documented for future generations
- Knowledge transfer sessions for tribal IT staff
- Emergency procedures without VLM (backup to manual monitoring)
