## Seven Generations Consideration

These whitepapers document not just features, but philosophy. The governance-first approach, collective intelligence, and anticipatory memory represent a different way of building AI - one that respects long-term consequences and values transparency.

"We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children."

For Seven Generations.
