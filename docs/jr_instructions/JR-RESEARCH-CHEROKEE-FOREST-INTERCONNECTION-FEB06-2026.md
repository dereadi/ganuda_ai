**Priority:** P2 - Knowledge Building
**Assigned To:** Research Jr (or available Jr with research capability)
**Estimated Duration:** 4-6 hours
**Task Type:** RESEARCH

- Place names reflecting forest relationships

### Area 7: Specific Tree Relationships
Research Cherokee relationships with these key species:
- **Oak (Tsuga)** - Acorns, cultural significance
- **Hickory** - Nut trees, seasonal importance
- **Cedar/Juniper** - Ceremonial uses, protective qualities
- **Pine** - Practical and spiritual uses
- **Tulip Poplar** - Canoe tree, cultural importance

## Sources to AVOID

**DO NOT USE these source types:**
- New Age or neo-pagan interpretations of Cherokee spirituality
- "Pan-Indian" generalizations that conflate distinct tribal traditions
- Sources attributing other tribes' practices to Cherokee
- Non-Cherokee authors claiming insider spiritual knowledge
- Commercial "Native American spirituality" websites
- Sources that commodify or appropriate Cherokee sacred practices
- Wikipedia without verification from primary sources
- Social media posts without verifiable attribution

**Red Flags to Watch For:**
- Claims of "secret" or "hidden" teachings
- Mixing Cherokee with Lakota, Navajo, or other tribal practices
- Use of terms like "Indian," "Native American spirituality" generically
- Authors selling ceremonies, vision quests, or spiritual services
- Sources that don't distinguish between Cherokee Nation, EBCI, and UKB

---

## Research Methodology

### Step 1: Official Tribal Resources
Search Cherokee Nation and EBCI official websites for:
- Cultural education materials
- Language resources mentioning plants/trees
- Environmental or natural resources department publications
- Museum and heritage center educational content

### Step 2: Academic Database Search
Search terms:
- "Cherokee ethnobotany"
- "Cherokee traditional ecological knowledge"
- "Cherokee forest management"
- "Cherokee plant relationships"
- "Cherokee cosmology nature"
- "Tsalagi plant medicine" (using Cherokee self-designation)

### Step 3: Language Resources
Search Cherokee language dictionaries and learning materials for:
- Plant and tree vocabulary
- Relationship terms applied to non-humans
- Verbs for plant actions or awareness

### Step 4: Comparative Analysis
After gathering Cherokee sources, compare to:
- Suzanne Simard's research on mycorrhizal networks
- Peter Wohlleben's "The Hidden Life of Trees"
- Robin Wall Kimmerer's "Braiding Sweetgrass" (Potawatomi perspective for comparison, clearly marked)

### Step 5: Gap Analysis
Document what you could NOT find:
- Topics with limited available sources
- Areas needing further research with Cherokee communities
- Questions that require direct community engagement to answer

## Ethical Guidelines

1. **Respect Intellectual Property:** Cherokee traditional knowledge belongs to Cherokee people. This research is for educational understanding, not appropriation.

2. **Cite Properly:** Always attribute teachings to specific sources. Avoid generalizing "the Cherokee believe..."

3. **Acknowledge Limitations:** Outsider research has inherent limitations. Note where direct community engagement would be needed.

4. **Sacred/Secular Distinction:** Some knowledge may be sacred and intentionally not publicly documented. Respect these boundaries.

5. **Living Tradition:** Cherokee culture is living and evolving, not frozen in the past. Note contemporary perspectives.

6. **Three Federally Recognized Nations:** Cherokee Nation (OK), Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (NC), and United Keetoowah Band (OK) are distinct political entities. Note which community sources come from.
