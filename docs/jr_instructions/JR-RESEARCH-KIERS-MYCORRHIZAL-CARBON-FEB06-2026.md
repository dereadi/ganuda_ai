## Notes for Jr

This research supports our climate intelligence capabilities. Mycorrhizal networks represent a potentially significant natural carbon sink that is often overlooked in climate models. Dr. Kiers' work bridges ecology, climate science, and practical restoration - exactly the kind of systems-thinking we value.

The Seven Generations assessment is particularly important here - these underground networks have existed for 450 million years and represent deep wisdom about earth systems.
