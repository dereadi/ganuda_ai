# VLM Strategic Alignment Document
Cherokee AI Federation - Raven Strategic Planning

## Federation Roadmap Position

### Current Phase: Phase 3 - Hardening & Packaging
VLM integration fits within:
- **Service Enhancement**: Expanding council specialist capabilities
- **Infrastructure Maturity**: Adding GPU-accelerated AI services

### Alignment with Long-Term Vision

| Strategic Goal | VLM Contribution |
|----------------|------------------|
| Self-sufficient AI infrastructure | Local VLM reduces external dependencies |
| Council-based governance | VLM enhances specialist decision-making |
| Seven Generations sustainability | Documented, transferable AI capability |
| Tribal data sovereignty | All processing on tribal infrastructure |

## Resource Allocation

### Hardware
- **Primary**: redfin RTX 4090 (existing)
- **Backup**: sasass M4 Max (existing)
- **Additional**: None required initially

### Personnel
- **Implementation**: Jr agents (token-efficient)
- **Oversight**: TPM coordination
- **Training**: IT staff familiarization (2 sessions)

### Budget Impact
- Software: $0 (open-source models)
- Hardware: $0 (existing infrastructure)
- Operational: ~$15/month electricity increase

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Milestone |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Phase 0 | 1 week | Stakeholder consultation complete |
| Phase 1-3 | Completed | Core infrastructure deployed |
| Phase 4-6 | Completed | Documentation complete |
| **Production** | Week 4 | VLM live in production |

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| GPU resource contention | Medium | Medium | Resource limits, overflow to sasass |
| Model accuracy issues | Low | Medium | Human review of anomaly flags |
| Security vulnerability | Low | High | Sandbox testing, audit |
| Community pushback | Low | High | Elder consultation, transparency |

## Success Criteria

1. VLM operational with <5s latency
2. All council concerns addressed
3. Zero security incidents
4. Positive community feedback
5. Measurable improvement in security response
