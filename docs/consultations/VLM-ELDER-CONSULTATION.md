into our security systems while respecting Cherokee values.

3. What boundaries should exist for AI observation?

### On Privacy and Community
1. How do we balance security with privacy for community members?
2. Are there areas where AI observation should never occur?
3. How do we inform visitors about AI-enhanced monitoring?

### On Long-Term Impact
