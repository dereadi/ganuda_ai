Subject: Pro-Bono Request: Veteran-Owned AI Healthcare Startup Serving Veterans

Dear [Clinic Director],

I am reaching out to request pro-bono legal assistance for a veteran-owned
technology startup that serves the veteran community.

Company: Ganuda AI - VetAssist Platform
Mission: AI-powered VA disability claims assistance for veterans
Founder: Veteran-owned and operated
Stage: Pre-launch prototype, planning public launch in 2025

Legal Needs:

- Corporate structure guidance (veteran-owned business certification)
- Regulatory compliance review (Unauthorized Practice of Law, medical advice)

Why This Matters:
Our platform aims to help 19 million U.S. veterans navigate the complex VA
disability claims process using AI technology. We're building an affordable
alternative to predatory consultants who charge 30% contingency fees.

Veteran Impact:
- Average successful claim: $568,000 lifetime benefit for veteran
- Current claim denial rate: 40-50% (often due to poor documentation)
- Our goal: Democratize access to quality claim assistance

Timeline: Planning public launch Q2 2025
Budget: Bootstrapped veteran-owned startup, cannot afford $20-55K legal fees

Would your clinic be interested in supporting this veteran-serving mission?

Happy to provide additional information or schedule a call.

Respectfully,
[Your Name]
Founder, Ganuda AI
[Contact Information]

**Typical Discount:** 20-30% off standard rates
**How to Find:** Ask your VBOC counselor for referrals

**What to Negotiate:**

**Fixed Fee Package (Recommended):**
Instead of hourly billing, negotiate flat rate for specific deliverables:

| Service | Typical Cost | Discounted | Fixed Fee Target |
|---------|-------------|------------|------------------|
| Incorporation (LLC/C-Corp) | $2,000-5,000 | $1,500-3,500 | $2,000 |
| Terms of Service | $3,000-8,000 | $2,000-5,000 | $2,500 |
| Privacy Policy (HIPAA) | $5,000-10,000 | $3,500-7,000 | $4,000 |
| Disclaimer Package | $1,000-3,000 | $700-2,000 | $1,000 |
| Legal Opinion Letter | $2,000-5,000 | $1,500-3,500 | $1,500 |
| **TOTAL** | **$13,000-31,000** | **$9,200-21,000** | **$11,000** |

**Negotiation Script:**
> "As a veteran-owned startup serving veterans, we're bootstrapped and need to keep
> legal costs under $10-15K. Could you offer a fixed-fee package for the essentials
> (TOS, Privacy Policy, disclaimers, incorporation)? We're also happy to provide
> testimonial/referral to other veteran entrepreneurs in exchange."

---

### Option 2: Early-Stage Startup Packages

**Law Firms with Startup Programs:**

**1. Orrick's OnRamp**
- Fixed-fee packages for startups

**Negotiation Tip:** Mention veteran-owned + veteran-serving mission. Many firms have diversity/social impact initiatives that may qualify you for discounted rates.

---

### Option 3: Deferred Payment / Equity Arrangements

**How It Works:**
- Attorney agrees to discounted hourly rate + small equity stake (0.5-1%)
- Legal fees deferred until funding round or revenue milestone
- Attorney becomes advisor with vested interest in success

- Hourly rate: $200/hr (vs. $400-600/hr standard)
- Equity: 0.5-1% vesting over 2-4 years
- Deferred payment: Due upon Series A funding or $500K revenue

**Best For:** If you plan to raise venture capital in the future

**Firms Open to This:** Smaller boutique firms, solo practitioners

**How to Propose:**
> "We're a pre-revenue veteran-owned startup. Would you consider a hybrid arrangement
> of discounted hourly rate + small equity stake (0.5%) + deferred payment until our
> Series A? This aligns our success with your compensation."
