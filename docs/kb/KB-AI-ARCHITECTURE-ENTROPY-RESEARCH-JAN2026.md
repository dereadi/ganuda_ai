## Key Research Papers

### 1. AI-Powered Code Review with LLMs (arXiv:2404.18496)

**Finding:** Multi-agent systems for code review outperform single-agent approaches.

> "A novel approach to improving software quality through LLM-based agents designed to autonomously review code, identify bugs and code smells, provide improvement suggestions."

**Cherokee Relevance:** Validates our 7-Specialist Council model for architectural review.

### 2. Context Engineering for Multi-Agent Code Assistants (arXiv:2508.08322)

**Finding:** MASAI modular architecture achieves 28.33% resolution on SWE-Bench Lite.

> "Modular architecture of LLM-powered sub-agents, each responsible for a distinct phase such as test generation, issue reproduction, code editing, or solution ranking."

**Cherokee Relevance:** Supports our Jr specialization (SE Jr, IT Triad Jr, Research Jr, Infrastructure Jr).

### 3. Cognitive Workspace: Active Memory Management (arXiv:2508.13171)

**Finding:** "Cognitive Workspace" paradigm transcends RAG by emulating human cognitive mechanisms.

> "OS-inspired hierarchical memory systems implement virtual memory management concepts, with MemGPT exemplifying this approach through systems that page information between limited context windows and external storage."

**Cherokee Relevance:** Validates our thermal memory architecture with temperature-based decay.

---

### 4. Survey of Context Engineering for LLMs (arXiv:2507.13334)

**Finding:** Context Engineering is now a formal discipline beyond prompt engineering.

> "The performance of Large Language Models is fundamentally determined by the contextual information provided during inference. This survey introduces Context Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design."

**Cherokee Relevance:** Our thermal memory, KB articles, pheromone trails = context engineering.

### 5. Maximum Effective Context Window Study (arXiv:2509.21361)

**Finding:** NIAH tests don't represent real-world context usage.

> "Long context evaluations often demonstrate consistent performance across input lengths. However, these evaluations are narrow in scope and not representative of how long context is used in practice."

**Cherokee Relevance:** We need smart context retrieval (thermal memory queries) not just longer windows.

Source: [arXiv:2509.21361](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21361)

### 6. Context Rot Research (Chroma)

**Finding:** Context quality degrades with length - "context rot."

**Cherokee Relevance:** Validates our temperature decay in thermal memory and selective retrieval.

### 7. Developer Context for AI Coding Assistants (arXiv:2512.18925)

**Finding:** Five themes of essential project context identified.

> "Through qualitative analysis of 401 open-source repositories, researchers developed a taxonomy: Conventions, Guidelines, Project Information, LLM Directives, and Examples."

**Cherokee Relevance:** Maps to our context sources: JR instructions (conventions), KB (guidelines), CMDB (project info), Council (directives), pheromones (examples).

## Research Gaps / Future Work

1. **Entropy Measurement** - No standard metrics for codebase entropy
2. **Knowledge Decay Rates** - Need empirical study of institutional knowledge loss
3. **Pattern Governance** - Who decides which patterns to enforce?
4. **Human-AI Handoff** - When should AI defer to human judgment?
