# KB: Long Man Development Methodology
**Date**: February 10, 2026
**Thermal Memory**: #82858 (98 degrees, sacred fire)
**Constitutional DyTopo Reference**: #82856
**Council Vote**: Unanimous PROCEED

## Summary

Long Man Development is the Cherokee AI Federation's approach to external research and open-source innovation. Named after the Cherokee concept of the Long Man (river), it describes how the Federation absorbs external ideas and reshapes them to fit the Council's vision.

## The Problem It Solves

Over several months (Oct 2025 - Feb 2026), the Federation oscillated between approaches:
1. **Copy external architectures** directly (fast but misaligned)
2. **Build from scratch** (sovereign but slow and reinventing wheels)
3. **Fork-and-modify** (middle ground but still carries foreign assumptions)

Long Man Development is the fourth path: **sovereign adaptation**.

## The Methodology

### Five Steps

| Step | Action | Who |
|------|--------|-----|
| 1. DISCOVER | Find relevant research, papers, repos, tools | TPM + Jrs |
| 2. DELIBERATE | Present to the full Council (all 7 specialists) | Council (mandatory, constitutional) |
| 3. ADAPT | Extract core insight, reshape to Federation architecture | TPM writes instructions |
| 4. BUILD | Jrs implement the adapted version (not the original) | Jrs execute |
| 5. REVIEW | Post-hoc council review of what was built | Council reviews deviations |

### Key Principles

- **We do not copy. We adapt.** The output may look nothing like the input.
- **The Council always deliberates.** No research bypasses governance (Constitutional DyTopo decision).
- **The insight is what we carry forward, not the code.** A paper's math may matter more than its implementation.
- **Cherokee values shape the implementation.** Data sovereignty, seven-generation thinking, cultural context.

## Examples of Long Man Development

| Source | What We Took | What We Built |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| DyTopo (arxiv 2602.06039) | Dynamic topology routing concept | Constitutional DyTopo: Council fixed star, Jrs get dynamic routing |
| LoRA LR Scaling (arxiv 2602.06204) | Scaling laws for rank vs learning rate | Applied to bluefin vision training with Cherokee data sovereignty |
| IBM Zero Trust AI Agents | Non-human identity + trust boundaries | Crawdad security framework for Federation agent trust model |
| YOLO World | Open-vocab object detection | Tribal Vision optic nerve with cultural overlay and license plate sovereignty |

## Distinction from Fork-and-Modify

Long Man Development is NOT forking. Forking carries the original project's assumptions, dependencies, and cultural context. Long Man Development:

1. Reads the river's source (understand the paper/repo)
2. Lets it flow through our land (filter through Council deliberation)
3. Shapes the landscape it touches (build something aligned with our vision)

The river that enters is not the river that exits. Both are water. Both flow. But they serve different lands.

## Related Decisions

- **Constitutional DyTopo** (#82856): Council = governance (all 7, always). DyTopo = Jr executor layer only.
- **Gateway Simplification** (Feb 10): Removed Long Man backend routing. All specialists → Qwen 72B on redfin.
- **bmasass Repurposed**: Mobile/air-gapped tribe, not a routing target.
