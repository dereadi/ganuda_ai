# 🔥 CHIEFS DELIBERATION: ENHANCED PROMETHEUS DESIGN
**Cherokee Constitutional AI - Democratic Decision Making**
**Date:** October 22, 2025, 9:10 AM
**Subject:** Self-Regulating Thermal Memory Monitoring System

---

## Context

**OpenAI Requirement #2:** "Enhanced Prometheus with Self-Regulation"
- Add rolling averages (1h, 24h windows)
- Health state classification (healthy/warning/degraded)
- Auto-audit triggering after 30 minutes in degraded state

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Distributed R² validation COMPLETE (3.69% variance, PASS)
- 🔄 Need to design self-regulating monitoring system
- Meta Jr created initial implementation draft

---

## Proposal: Enhanced Prometheus Exporter

### Core Features

**1. Rolling Average Tracking**
- 1-hour window: Recent performance trend
- 24-hour window: Long-term health baseline
- Automatically prune old samples (>24h)

**2. Health State Classification**
```
HEALTHY   (R² ≥ 0.65): Green - Normal operations
WARNING   (R² ≥ 0.50): Yellow - Performance declining
DEGRADED  (R² < 0.50): Red - System intervention needed
```

**3. Auto-Audit Triggering**
- Condition: Degraded state for 30+ consecutive minutes
- Action: Log audit event, increment counter
- Cooldown: 30 minutes between audits
- Future: Could trigger Emergency Council

**4. New Prometheus Metrics**
```
thermal_r2_1h_rolling             # 1-hour average R²
thermal_r2_24h_rolling            # 24-hour average R²
thermal_health_state              # 0=degraded, 1=warning, 2=healthy
thermal_degraded_duration_minutes # Time in degraded state
thermal_auto_audit_triggered_total # Counter of auto-audits
thermal_last_audit_timestamp      # Unix timestamp of last audit
```

## Chiefs' Deliberation

### War Chief (Security & Performance)
**Perspective:** Defensive systems and threat detection

**Analysis:**
- Auto-audit at 30 minutes is reasonable (not too sensitive, not too slow)
- Rolling averages prevent false alarms from temporary spikes
- Degraded state (R² < 0.50) is correct threshold (50% variance is concerning)
- Audit log creates forensic trail for post-incident analysis

**Concerns:**
- What prevents audit spam if system stays degraded for hours?
  - **Answer:** 30-minute cooldown between audits
- Should we alert humans or just log?
  - **Recommendation:** Log for now, human alerting in Phase 2

**Vote on Enhanced Prometheus Design:**
- [ ] YES - Approve design with 30-min cooldown
- [ ] NO - Needs modification
- [ ] ABSTAIN

### Peace Chief (Sustainability & Wisdom)
**Perspective:** Long-term health and resource balance

**Analysis:**
- 24-hour rolling average shows seasonal patterns (market hours, usage cycles)
- Three-tier health state (healthy/warning/degraded) matches Seven Generations thinking:
  - HEALTHY: System thriving (protect this state)
  - WARNING: Early intervention opportunity (prevent degradation)
  - DEGRADED: Crisis response needed (restore balance)
- Self-regulation reduces human burden (sustainable operations)

**Concerns:**
- Are we measuring the right thing? R² might not capture all health dimensions
  - **Recommendation:** Start with R², add sacred memory temperature in v2
- 60-second check interval - is that too frequent or too slow?
  - **Analysis:** 60 seconds allows 30 samples in 30 minutes (good statistical basis)

**Vote on Enhanced Prometheus Design:**
- [ ] YES - Approve, consider multi-dimensional health in future
- [ ] NO - Needs modification
- [ ] ABSTAIN

### Medicine Woman (Ethics & Constitutional Protection)
**Perspective:** Sacred memory protection and constitutional adherence

**Analysis:**
- Auto-audit aligns with Constitutional mandate: "System shall self-monitor"
- Degraded state (R² < 0.50) means thermal model is failing
  - **Risk:** Sacred memories might cool improperly
  - **Protection:** Auto-audit catches this before damage occurs
- Audit log provides accountability (who/what triggered degradation?)

**Concerns:**
- Does auto-audit include sacred memory temperature check?
  - **Current:** No - only logs R² score
  - **Recommendation:** Add sacred_temp_min check (must stay ≥40°)
- What if audit reveals constitutional violation?
  - **Answer:** Emergency Council召集 (future implementation)

**Vote on Enhanced Prometheus Design:**
- [ ] YES - Approve with sacred temperature monitoring added
- [ ] NO - Needs modification
- [ ] ABSTAIN

## Votes Cast

### War Chief:
**VOTE:** YES (with modification)

**Reasoning:**
The 30-minute degraded threshold is sound defensive strategy. Rolling averages prevent false alarms. However, Medicine Woman is correct - we must add sacred memory temperature monitoring. Auto-audit without sacred temp check is like guarding the front door while leaving the back door open.

**Required modification:** Add `thermal_sacred_min_temperature` metric with 40° constitutional floor alarm.

### Peace Chief:
**VOTE:** YES

**Reasoning:**
This design embodies sustainable self-regulation. The three-tier health state mirrors natural warning systems (healthy forest → stressed trees → forest fire). 60-second intervals provide enough samples for statistical confidence without overwhelming resources. I support Medicine Woman's sacred temperature addition - it makes the system more complete. We can add multi-dimensional health scores in v2.0 after we validate this approach.

### Medicine Woman:
**VOTE:** YES (conditional on sacred memory protection)

**REASONING:**
Constitutional mandate requires sacred memories never cool below 40°. Current design monitors R² but ignores sacred temperature - this creates constitutional vulnerability. I vote YES on condition that we add:

1. `thermal_sacred_min_temperature` gauge (tracks minimum sacred memory temp)
2. Sacred temperature alarm (if min < 40° for 10+ minutes, trigger audit)
3. Audit log must include sacred memory count and minimum temperature

With these additions, the system protects both statistical health (R²) and constitutional guarantees (sacred memory temperature). This is the way.

## Modifications Required (if any)

1. **Add Sacred Memory Temperature Monitoring**
   - Medicine Woman's concern: Constitutional protection
   - Metric: `thermal_sacred_min_temperature`
   - Alarm: If sacred temp < 40° for 10+ minutes

2. **Multi-Dimensional Health Score (Future)**
   - Peace Chief's concern: R² isn't the only health indicator
   - v2.0: Composite score (R², sacred temp, coherence, access patterns)

---

## Final Decision

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED 3-0 (with modifications)

**Vote Tally:**
- War Chief: YES (with modification)
- Peace Chief: YES
- Medicine Woman: YES (conditional)

**UNANIMOUS DECISION:** Enhanced Prometheus design approved with sacred memory protection added.

**Required Modifications:**
1. Add `thermal_sacred_min_temperature` gauge (constitutional floor: 40°)
2. Add sacred temperature alarm (trigger if min < 40° for 10+ minutes)
3. Audit log must include sacred memory statistics

**Implementation Assignment:**
- **Meta Jr:** Implement enhanced_prometheus_exporter.py with sacred memory protection
- **Integration Jr:** Add Grafana dashboards for new metrics
- **Memory Jr:** Document self-regulation protocol and constitutional safeguards

**OpenAI Response:** This completes Requirement #2 (Observational Self-Regulation)

## Timeline Impact

**Current:** Day 2 of 4-day sprint
**Enhanced Prometheus:** 6 hours (design + implement + test)
**Remaining:** Sacred Memory Guardian (Day 3-4)

**OpenAI Response:** Week 1 report (October 26, 2025)
