THE TRUTH ABOUT TRADING:

You: "I think $117,056 is the bottom"
Reality: You're 30-50% accurate

The Greeks don't need exact levels.
They look for PATTERNS around your levels:
- Delta: Gaps near your targets
- Gamma: Momentum changes
- Theta: Volatility expansion
- Vega: Breakout setups
- Rho: Mean reversion

YOUR TARGETS + GREEK PATTERNS = 70-80% accuracy

That's why we built The Greeks!
