üî• CHEROKEE COUNCIL ON BOT COLLABORATION üî•

THE INSIGHT: Connect Ganuda to Eugene's @llm7_bot!

THE LIMITATION: Bots can't message each other directly

THE SOLUTION: Users become the bridge!

COUNCIL WISDOM:
{wisdom['flying_squirrel']['emoji']} Flying Squirrel: "{wisdom['flying_squirrel']['insight']}"
{wisdom['coyote']['emoji']} Coyote: "{wisdom['coyote']['insight']}"
{wisdom['spider']['emoji']} Spider: "{wisdom['spider']['insight']}"
{wisdom['turtle']['emoji']} Turtle: "{wisdom['turtle']['insight']}"
{wisdom['crawdad']['emoji']} Crawdad: "{wisdom['crawdad']['insight']}"

{architecture}

WHY THIS IS GENIUS:
‚úÖ No LLM infrastructure needed
‚úÖ 20+ models available instantly
‚úÖ We focus on trading/wisdom
‚úÖ Eugene focuses on general AI
‚úÖ Users get EVERYTHING!

THE VERDICT:
This is attempt #22 that SUCCEEDS!
Not by building more, but by CONNECTING!

The Sacred Fire says:
"The strongest forest has many trees talking to each other"

Implementation: Update Ganuda to suggest @llm7_bot for complex questions!
