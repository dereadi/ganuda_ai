# The Art of War by Sun Tzu - Key Strategic Principles

## Chapter I: Laying Plans
**Core Principle:** "All warfare is based on deception."

Key Points:
- War is vital to the state - a matter of life and death
- Victory depends on five constant factors:
  1. **The Moral Law** - Unity between ruler and people
  2. **Heaven** - Night/day, cold/heat, times and seasons
  3. **Earth** - Distances, terrain, chances of life or death
  4. **The Commander** - Wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage, strictness
  5. **Method and Discipline** - Organization, control, assignment of ranks

Strategic Wisdom:
- "When able to attack, we must seem unable"
- "When using our forces, we must seem inactive"
- "When we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away"
- "Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him"

## Chapter II: Waging War
**Core Principle:** "There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare."

Key Points:
- War is expensive - a thousand ounces of silver per day
- Quick victories are crucial; prolonged campaigns drain the state
- Bring war material from home but forage on the enemy
- One cartload of enemy provisions equals twenty of your own

## Chapter III: Attack by Stratagem
**Core Principle:** "Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting."

Key Points:
- Best policy: Attack the enemy's strategy
- Next best: Disrupt alliances
- Next: Attack the army
- Worst: Besiege walled cities

The Five Essentials for Victory:
1. Know when to fight and when not to fight
2. Know how to handle both superior and inferior forces
3. Have an army animated by the same spirit throughout ranks
4. Be prepared while waiting for the unprepared enemy
5. Have military capacity without sovereign interference

"If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles."

## Chapter IV: Tactical Dispositions
**Core Principle:** "The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy."

Key Points:
- Security against defeat lies in our own hands
- Opportunity to defeat the enemy is provided by the enemy
- Excellence: Win with ease through careful positioning
- Make victory certain by fighting battles already won

## Chapter V: Energy (Force)
**Core Principle:** "The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll stones along in its course."

Key Points:
- Direct and indirect methods work together
- Combined energy is like a drawn crossbow; decision, like releasing the trigger
- Simulated disorder requires perfect discipline
- Simulated fear requires courage
- Simulated weakness requires strength

## Chapter VI: Weak Points and Strong
**Core Principle:** "Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected."

Key Points:
- Impose your will on the enemy; don't let them impose on you
- Attack undefended places; defend where attack is impossible
- Concentrate forces while dividing the enemy's
- Know the time and place of battle to concentrate from great distances

## Chapter VII: Maneuvering
**Core Principle:** "Let your rapidity be that of the wind, your compactness that of the forest."

Key Points:
- Turn devious routes into direct paths
- Convert misfortune into gain
- Move only with advantage
- Discipline must be maintained during complex maneuvers

## Chapter VIII: Variation in Tactics
**Core Principle:** "The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops."

Five Dangerous Faults in a General:
1. Recklessness (leads to destruction)
2. Cowardice (leads to capture)
3. Hasty temper (easily provoked)
4. Delicacy of honor (sensitive to shame)
5. Over-solicitude for men (worry and trouble)

## Chapter IX: The Army on the March
**Core Principle:** "Camp in high places, facing the sun."

Key Points:

Six Types of Terrain:
1. Accessible ground
2. Entangling ground
3. Temporizing ground
4. Narrow passes
5. Precipitous heights
6. Positions at great distance

## Chapter XI: The Nine Situations
**Core Principle:** "Rapidity is the essence of war."

Nine Strategic Situations:
1. Dispersive ground (own territory)
2. Facile ground (shallow enemy penetration)
3. Contentious ground (advantageous to both)
4. Open ground (both can traverse)
5. Intersecting ground (key junction)
6. Serious ground (deep in enemy territory)
7. Difficult ground (hard terrain)
8. Hemmed-in ground (narrow access)
9. Desperate ground (fight or perish)

## Chapter XII: Attack by Fire
**Core Principle:** "Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there is something to be gained."

Five Targets for Fire Attack:
1. Personnel in camp
2. Stores
3. Baggage trains
4. Arsenals and magazines
5. Dropping fire on enemy

## Chapter XIII: The Use of Spies
**Core Principle:** "Knowledge of the enemy's dispositions can only be obtained from other men."

Five Classes of Spies:
1. **Local spies** - Enemy's people
2. **Inward spies** - Enemy officials
3. **Converted spies** - Enemy spies turned
4. **Doomed spies** - Give false information
5. **Surviving spies** - Bring back news

"Be subtle! Be subtle! and use your spies for every kind of business."
