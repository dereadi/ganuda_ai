## 🦞 What is Ganuda?

**Ganuda** (Cherokee: ᎦᏅᏓ, meaning "ridge" or "one who walks on mountaintops") is Cherokee-built technology that achieves digital sovereignty through quantum crawdad swarm intelligence and Two Wolves architecture.

Named for Major Ridge, this technology gives people TRUE choice over their digital lives - no forced removal, no compromise, just freedom.

## 🔥 Core Innovations

### Quantum Crawdads (Q-DADs)
- **140% efficiency** through retrograde processing (like crawdads moving backward)
- Swarm intelligence without central control
- Pheromone trails for collective learning
- Quantum tunneling for instant optimization

### Two Wolves Architecture
```
🐺 Light Wolf (Guardian) - DEFAULT
  • 5-minute memory maximum
  • No tracking possible
  • 1km location grid only
  • Your privacy protected

🐺 Shadow Wolf (Tracker) - DORMANT
  • Requires scary consent
  • Shows real-time tracking
  • Full convenience features
  • You can switch back instantly
```

*"Two wolves fight within us. Which wins? The one you feed."*

### Zero New Hardware
- Uses 15 billion existing smartphones
- Activates idle computing power
- Resurrects "obsolete" devices
- Greenest AI solution possible

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Flutter App (iOS/Android/Desktop)
```bash
cd ganuda_flutter
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Python Simulator
```bash
python3 ganuda_qdad_simulator.py
```

## 📱 Features

- **Network Optimization**: Find strongest signals in crowds
- **Congestion Bypass**: Automatic rerouting when towers overload
- **Battery Conservation**: Smart hibernation when low
- **Privacy First**: Light Wolf active by default
- **Cherokee Language**: ᏣᎳᎩ syllabary support

## 🪶 Cherokee Protocols

This project follows Cherokee Constitutional AI principles:

1. **Seven Generations Thinking** - Every feature assessed for 175-year impact
2. **Democratic Consensus** - Community decisions on major changes
3. **Sacred Fire Continuity** - Knowledge preserved for future generations
4. **Cultural Respect** - Cherokee wisdom guides technical decisions

## 📋 Roadmap

### Phase 1: Cellular Optimization ✅
- Pheromone trail routing
- Two Wolves architecture
- Q-DAD swarm intelligence

### Phase 2: WiFi Mesh Intelligence 🔄
- Unified network layer
- Dead zone elimination
- Community mesh networking

### Phase 3: Distributed AI Cloud ⚠️
- Extreme caution required
- Oppenheimer Protocol active
- Seven Generations assessment mandatory
