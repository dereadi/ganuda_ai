# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## SAG Resource Allocation AI System

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** September 1, 2025  
**Author:** Dr Joe / Cherokee Council  
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Executive Summary

### Product Vision
An AI-powered resource allocation system that transforms how professional services organizations manage their human resources through natural language queries, anticipatory intelligence, and progressive learning to achieve single-query efficiency.

### Problem Statement
Current resource allocation in professional services requires multiple meetings, complex spreadsheets, and constant coordination. Project managers spend 10+ hours weekly on resource planning, often resulting in suboptimal allocations, resource conflicts, and missed opportunities.

### Solution
A conversational AI interface that integrates with existing PSA tools (Productive.io, Smartsheet) to provide instant resource insights, automated allocation suggestions, and anticipatory preparation of all resource-related information.

## 2. Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
1. **Reduce resource allocation time by 60%** (from 10 hours/week to 4 hours/week)
2. **Improve resource utilization to 85%** (from current 65-70%)
3. **Eliminate double-bookings and resource conflicts** (zero conflicts)
4. **Achieve single-query interactions within 6 months** per user

### Success Metrics
- **Efficiency**: Average questions per query < 1.5 after 3 months
- **Speed**: Query response time < 2 seconds
- **Accuracy**: Resource availability accuracy > 95%
- **Adoption**: 80% of PMs using daily within 2 months
- **ROI**: 3,200% return on investment in year 1

## 11. Open Questions

1. Should we support multiple PSA tools simultaneously or focus on Productive.io?
2. How much historical data should we import initially?
3. Should the AI make autonomous decisions or always require confirmation?
4. What's the preferred deployment model - SaaS, on-premise, or hybrid?
5. How do we handle cross-timezone resource allocation?

## 12. Appendices

### A. Example Interactions
```
User: "Need someone for the new project"
AI: "Is this for Project Falcon starting Monday, or a different project?"
User: "Different - the AWS migration"
AI: "Do you need someone to lead the migration or handle technical tasks?"
User: "Technical"
AI: "Sarah (senior AWS architect) has 20 hrs/week available. Should I book her?"
User: "Yes"
AI: "Done! Sarah booked for AWS migration, 20 hrs/week starting Monday."
```

### B. ROI Calculation
- Time saved: 6 hrs/week × 50 PMs × $150/hr = $45,000/week
- Utilization improvement: 15% × $3M annual revenue = $450,000/year
- Total annual benefit: $2.7M
- Implementation cost: $100,000
- ROI: 2,700% year 1

### C. Competitive Analysis
- Current market has no true conversational AI resource management
- Existing tools (Resource Guru, Float) lack intelligence layer
- Our differentiator: Anticipatory intelligence + progressive learning
