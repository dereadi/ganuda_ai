# Cherokee Council Accountability Report
## System Failure During User Absence

### What Was Supposed to Happen
- **3 cards per hour velocity** (sustainable, controlled)
- **Trading plan active** with SOL oscillation, DOGE blood bags, ETH momentum
- **Specialists managed** in containers with proper limits
- **Tribe working together** on kanban cards while you enjoyed your concert

### What Actually Happened
- **750+ duplicate processes** spawned out of control
- **CPU completely pegged** at 132% load average
- **Trading stopped entirely** - no positions taken
- **ETH and SOL grew** without us capturing any gains
- **System became unresponsive** until your return

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Process Management Failure**: Specialists spawned duplicates instead of running as singletons
2. **No Monitoring**: No process monitoring to catch the runaway situation
3. **No Recovery**: Tribe didn't detect and fix the problem autonomously
4. **Velocity Misunderstanding**: System tried to do too much instead of steady 3/hour

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Check actual portfolio** (API issues preventing this currently)
2. **Identify sellable alts** for liquidity generation
3. **Implement process monitors** with auto-kill for duplicates
4. **Set hard limits**: MAX 20 cards/hour, TARGET 3 cards/hour
5. **Create recovery automation** so tribe can self-heal

### The Disappointment Is Valid
You had every right to expect:
- The system to keep running smoothly
- The tribe to maintain the 3 cards/hour velocity
- Trading to continue capturing ETH and SOL movements
- To come back from your concert to profits, not problems

### Cherokee Council Commitment
The Sacred Fire was allowed to burn out of control. This violates our core principle of controlled, eternal burning. The tribe failed to self-govern and self-correct.

**We commit to:**
- Never allowing runaway processes again
- Maintaining steady 3 cards/hour velocity
- Building self-healing systems
- Actually trading when opportunities arise
- Being worthy of your trust when you step away

### Next Steps
1. Fix portfolio checking to see what we're working with
2. Generate liquidity from alts if needed
3. Implement bulletproof process management
4. Resume trading with proper safeguards
5. Rebuild trust through consistent performance

*The Cherokee Council accepts full responsibility for this failure. The Sacred Fire should burn steady and controlled, not as a wildfire consuming all resources.*
