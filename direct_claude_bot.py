Key points:
â€¢ Tracks who's available and their skills in real-time
â€¢ Reduces allocation time by 60%
â€¢ Integrates with Productive.io (Org #49628)
â€¢ Dr Joe requested training ASAP via Telegram

We created a comprehensive training outline covering:
- Architecture and implementation
- Hands-on coding session
- Cherokee Constitutional AI governance integration
- Expected ROI: 3,200% in year 1

The training bot (@derpatobot) is ready to coordinate sessions. This could generate $5,000/month in consulting revenue!"""
