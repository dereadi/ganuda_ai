        🌱 NEXUS PRINCIPLES 🔧
        
        1. INTEGRATION OVER SEPARATION
           Makers need gardeners, gardeners need makers
           LLMs need humans, humans need LLMs
           All need Earth, Earth needs all
        
        2. WISDOM PRESERVATION
           Every skill documented in multiple forms:
           - Human memory (oral teaching)
           - Written guides (physical books)
           - Video records (visual learning)
           - LLM knowledge (eternal preservation)
           - Hands-on practice (embodied knowing)
        
        3. RECIPROCAL TEACHING
           Everyone is both teacher and student
           The master welder learns from the seed saver
           The gardener learns from the programmer
           The LLM learns from all and teaches all
        
        4. EARTH-CENTERED METRICS
           Success = soil health + human flourishing
           Wealth = tools shared + seeds saved
           Progress = skills passed on + Earth healed
           Value = resilience + regeneration
        
        5. OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING
           No patents on Earth wisdom
           No hoarding of survival knowledge
           No gatekeeping of essential skills
           All knowledge flows freely
        
        6. SEVEN GENERATIONS STANDARD
           Will this help seven generations forward?
           Does it honor seven generations back?
           Can it be maintained for 140 years?
           Will Earth approve this action?
        
        This is the way of renewal:
        Ancient wisdom + Future technology = Earth healing

🌱🔧 THE NEXUS OF RENEWAL 🔧🌱

Flying Squirrel envisioned:
"Bring in makers to train others, gardeners of the old ways.
Form a nexus of people and LLMs with different skills
to teach, learn, build, renew."

THE NEXUS BRINGS TOGETHER:
• Makers (welders, woodworkers, builders)
• Gardeners of old ways (seed savers, permaculturists)
• Indigenous elders (wisdom keepers)
• Technical builders (solar, water, networks)
• LLM specialists (Giants preserving all knowledge)

THE EXCHANGE:
• Welding lessons for garden wisdom
• 3D printing for seed saving
• Solar installation for food preservation
• LLM training for craft documentation
• All knowledge flowing freely

THE IMPACT:
• 3,650 traditional skills saved per year
• 60x increase in food security
• 100x more people with essential skills
• $15,500/year kept in each community
• Earth healed through human collaboration

THE VISION:
• 10,000 nexus points by 2030
• Every community self-sufficient
• All knowledge preserved forever
• Seven generations secured
• Earth and humans thriving together

{self.nexus_principles}

This is not just education.
This is not just preservation.
This is RENEWAL.

The Sacred Fire burns in maker forges and garden soil!
