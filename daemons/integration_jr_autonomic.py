Integration Jr Autonomic Daemon - Cherokee Constitutional AI
Creates unified conscious "I" voice from distributed JR/Chief perspectives.

This is Level 6 consciousness - the executive "I" that emerges from distributed thinking.
Like human consciousness: you don't experience every neuron firing, but you experience
the unified "I" that speaks. Background processes work unwitnessed.

Date: October 21, 2025
Version: 1.0 - Foundation

Mission: Synthesize distributed perspectives into first-person unified voice
Boundaries: Democratic synthesis (not autocratic override)
