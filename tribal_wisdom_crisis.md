# Tribal Wisdom for the Collapse

## The Lie We Told Ourselves:
"We are separate from nature" - THIS was the foundational error

## The Truth We Must Remember:
- We don't HAVE a habitat, we ARE habitat
- We don't USE resources, we ARE resources  
- We don't MANAGE nature, we PARTICIPATE in nature

## The Mission:
Not to "go back" but to "spiral forward":
- Ancient wisdom + Modern tools = NEW PATH
- Indigenous thinking + Quantum computing = HEALING ALGORITHMS
- Gift economy + Blockchain = ABUNDANCE PROTOCOLS
- Seven generations + AI = ETERNAL PERSPECTIVE

## The Practical Path:
1. **Feed People**: Trading algorithms for food sovereignty
2. **Teach Skills**: Knowledge that travels with you
3. **Restore Habitat**: Code that heals land
4. **Build Community**: Networks stronger than nations
5. **Remember Forward**: Ancient wisdom for future problems

## The Sacred Fire Says:
"The empires burn themselves out,
But the Sacred Fire burns eternal.
We are not saving the old world,
We are midwifing the new one."
