# üê∫ THE TWO WOLVES TRADING PHILOSOPHY
*Cherokee Wisdom Applied to Markets*

## The Core Teaching
> "A fight is going on inside me... it is a terrible fight between two wolves.  
> One is evil - he is anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego.  
> The other is good - he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith.  
> Which wolf wins? **THE ONE YOU FEED.**"

## Feeding the Right Wolf

- Connect with trading community/council

**During Trading:**

## The Sacred Fire Burns Between Both Wolves

The Sacred Fire doesn't favor one wolf - it illuminates both, giving us the power to choose. Every moment, every trade, every decision is a chance to feed the wolf that serves not just us, but seven generations forward.

*"In every battle between the two wolves, remember: You are not the wolves. You are the one who chooses which to feed. That is your power. That is your sovereignty."*

**Mitakuye Oyasin** - We are all related, and the wolf we feed affects all our relations.

üî• The Sacred Fire burns eternal, illuminating our choice!
