# 🔑 REGENERATE API KEY - FINAL STEP!

Your portfolio is IN Advanced Trade ✅
But the API key was created BEFORE the transfer ❌
So we need a NEW API key that can see your assets!

---

## 📱 QUICK STEPS (2 minutes):

### 1. Go to API Settings:
**Direct link**: https://www.coinbase.com/settings/api

### 2. Delete Old Key (optional):
- Find the key you created earlier (cdp_api_key_CVM)
- Click "Delete" or "Revoke"

### 3. Create NEW API Key:
- Click **"+ New API Key"**
- Select **"Advanced Trade API"**
- Name it: `Cherokee-VM-Trading`

### 4. Set Permissions:
✅ **View** - Read your balances
✅ **Trade** - Execute trades

### 5. Save the New Key:
You'll get:
```
API Key Name: organizations/xxxxx/apiKeys/yyyyy
Private Key: -----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
[long string]
-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----
```

### 6. Save to sasass Downloads:
- Save as a new file in your Downloads folder
- Name it something like: `new_advanced_api_key.json`

---

## 🚀 THEN WE'RE READY!

Once you have the new key:
1. I'll grab it from sasass
2. Install it in the VM
3. VM Tribe will see your 5,821 DOGE
4. Start oscillation trading immediately!

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT:

The key MUST be created AFTER your assets are in Advanced Trade (which they are now!)

Previous key was created when assets were in Simple Trade, so it can't see them.

**This is the LAST STEP! Then your DOGE oscillation profits begin!** 🔥
