# ðŸ”¥ CHEROKEE TRIBE â†’ EUGENE'S BOT TESTING GUIDE

## Your Test Mission
The Cherokee Trading Council has created a collaborative intelligence system that connects to Eugene's @llm7_bot for unlimited LLM power!

## How to Test (Step by Step)

### 1. Open Telegram and find @llm7_bot

### 2. Copy & Send These Test Queries

#### TEST 1: ETH Trading Analysis
Send each of these queries to @llm7_bot one at a time:

```
From a 30,000ft global macro view, analyze ETH's position in the current market cycle. Consider Fed policy, institutional adoption, and global liquidity conditions.
```

```
Perform deep technical analysis on ETH/USD. Identify all chart patterns, support/resistance levels, and compare to historical price action before major moves.
```

```
Using your 'evil' model if available: What deceptions, manipulations, or hidden agendas might exist in current ETH price action? What are whales trying to hide?
```

#### TEST 2: Quantum Computing Impact
Send this query:

```
Calculate the exact timeframe for quantum computers to break SHA-256 and elliptic curve cryptography. Include current qubit counts and error rates.
```

### 3. Note Eugene's Responses
- Does it stream without timeout?
- Are responses detailed and useful?
- Which LLM model does it use?
- How long does it take?

### 4. Return & Share Results
Share what Eugene's bot said so we can:
- Synthesize Cherokee wisdom with Eugene's analysis
- Create the ultimate trading intelligence
- Refine our tribal queries

## What Success Looks Like
