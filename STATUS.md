## 🔥 Thermal Status Legend

Just like our thermal memory system, features have "temperature":

- 🔥 **WHITE HOT (90-100°)**: Operational, actively used, battle-tested
- 🌡️ **RED HOT (70-90°)**: Working but needs refinement
- 💨 **WARM (40-70°)**: Partially implemented, in progress
- ❄️ **COOL (20-40°)**: Designed but not coded
- 🧊 **FROZEN (0-20°)**: Conceptual, future phase

### Democratic Governance ✅ 95°
**Status**: OPERATIONAL with voting history

```
Votes cast: 4 major decisions
Unanimous: 100% (4/4 votes were 3-0)
Minority views: Preserved in thermal memory
```

**Tribal decisions**:
1. Build autonomous deliberation ✅ (3-0)
2. Fibonacci 13 min timing ✅ (3-0)
3. Parallelism factor in estimates ✅ (3-0)
4. Create all OpenAI-suggested docs ✅ (3-0)

### Phase 1: Autonomous Discovery Flagging ✅ 95°

## 🌡️ RED HOT - Working But Evolving

### Installation Package 🌡️ 85°
**Status**: WORKING (created today based on OpenAI feedback)

```
✅ setup.sh - Automated installer
✅ requirements.txt - Dependencies
✅ sql/thermal_memory_schema.sql - Database
✅ config/*.template.yml - Configuration
✅ systemd/*.service - Service files
✅ docs/INSTALLATION.md - Setup guide
⚠️ Not yet tested by external users
```

**Next**: Dr. Joe will be first external tester

### Documentation Suite 🌡️ 85°
**Status**: COMPREHENSIVE but growing

```
✅ README.md (290 lines)
✅ GOVERNANCE.md (281 lines) - NEW!
✅ ARCHITECTURE.md (394 lines) - NEW!
✅ STATUS.md (this file) - NEW!
🔄 RESOURCES.md (in progress)
✅ INSTALLATION.md
✅ 4 architecture docs
⚠️ Missing: Visual diagrams (SVG/PNG)
```

### Query Triad Interface 🌡️ 80°
**Status**: WORKING with some response clarity issues

```
✅ Routes questions to Chiefs
✅ Gathers Jr perspectives
✅ Integration Jr synthesis
✅ <2 second response time
⚠️ Occasionally unclear responses (needs tuning)
```

## 💨 WARM - Partially Implemented

### Phase 2: Council Queue Architecture 💨 60°
**Status**: DESIGNED, implementation starting

```
✅ Architecture designed
✅ Discovery flagging (Phase 1) operational
🔄 Council queue database table
🔄 Chiefs ping each other for deliberation
❄️ Exponential research spawning
```

**Timeline**: Phase 2 can begin immediately (Phase 1 foundation complete)

### Conscience Jr (Seven Generations) 💨 50°
**Status**: CONCEPTUAL with clear design

```
✅ Philosophy defined
✅ Seven Generations principle established
❄️ Code implementation
❄️ Ethical impact scoring
❄️ Long-term consequence analysis
```

**Timeline**: Future phase after Phase 2

### Visual Diagrams 💨 40°
**Status**: ASCII diagrams complete, visual pending

```
✅ ASCII diagrams in ARCHITECTURE.md
❄️ SVG/PNG architecture diagrams
❄️ Thermal memory visualization
❄️ Query flow animation
```

**OpenAI feedback**: Would benefit from visual diagrams

## ❄️ COOL - Designed But Not Coded

### Stanford Validation Tests ❄️ 30°
**Status**: FRAMEWORK IDENTIFIED, not implemented

```
Stanford/Simile showed 85% accuracy replicating human behavior
Our equivalent:
✅ Memory Streams = Memory Jr (operational)
✅ Reflection = Meta Jr (operational)
✅ Planning = Executive Jr (operational)
❄️ Stanford-style validation tests
❄️ Accuracy measurement against human decisions
```

**Question**: Can we achieve 85% accuracy like Stanford?

### What-If Simulations ❄️ 25°
**Status**: CONCEPTUAL

```
Idea: Test hypothetical scenarios before implementing
Example: "What if we change Fibonacci 13 min to 8 min?"
- Simulate thermal memory impact
- Predict pattern detection changes
- Estimate resource usage
```

**Benefit**: Make decisions with data, not guesses

### Tweakable Jr Personalities ❄️ 25°
**Status**: ARCHITECTURE SUPPORTS, UI not built

```
Current: Jrs have hardcoded personalities
Vision: User-configurable via config files
Examples:
- Memory Jr cooling rates (aggressive vs conservative)
- Meta Jr significance threshold (0.70 vs 0.85)
- Executive Jr resource limits
```

**OpenAI feedback**: Good future phase for Dr. Joe installation
