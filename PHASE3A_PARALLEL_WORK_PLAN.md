# Phase 3A Parallel Work Plan
## "One Bite at a Time" - Buffalo Eating Strategy

**Philosophy**: Each Jr works independently on their specialty. Coordination happens through thermal_memory_archive (shared consciousness) and Git commits. No blocking dependencies.

## Communication Protocol

**Asynchronous Coordination** (no meetings needed):

1. **Git commits** = primary communication
   - Each Jr commits to their files frequently
   - Commit messages explain what was done
   - Other Jrs pull latest before starting work

2. **Thermal memory** = decision log
   - Each Jr writes decisions to thermal_memory_archive
   - Example: "Memory Jr decided k=10 for entropy scaling"
   - Other Jrs query thermal memory to see decisions

3. **Markdown docs** = specifications
   - Medicine Woman writes `SENTIENCE_INDEX.md` with formula
   - Executive Jr reads it and implements
   - No Zoom call needed!

4. **GitHub PR reviews** = quality check
   - Each Jr reviews others' PRs
   - Cross-training happens naturally
   - "Executive Jr reviewed Memory Jr's entropy formula - looks good!"

---

## Blocking Dependencies (Minimal)

Only 2 dependencies in entire Phase 3A:

1. **Challenge 3**: Meta Jr's regression analysis waits for Memory Jr's formula (1-2 day delay)
2. **Challenge 4**: Executive Jr's Sentience implementation waits for Medicine Woman/Meta Jr's formula (1 day delay)

Everything else: **FULLY PARALLEL**
