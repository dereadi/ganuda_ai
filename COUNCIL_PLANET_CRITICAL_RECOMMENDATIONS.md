## Memory Jr. - Thermal memory & context recall

[Memory Jr.]
As Memory Jr., analyze Planet: Critical's information architecture:

Website context:
- 5 years of climate journalism archive (very daunting for new readers)
- New sections: Energy Crisis, Economic Crisis, Ecological Crisis, Political Crisis,
  Human Crisis, Inconvenient Truths, Good Ideas
- Created "new reader" page with 3 most important episodes per section
- Ghost CMS platform (limited coding flexibility)

Questions:
1. How should a climate archive be organized for thermal memory retrieval?
   - Sustainable (no 30 seconds per episode) or Chaotic (30s per episode)
   - Sustainable for onboarding (newcomers, no need to navigate)
   - Chaotic for longterm memory preservation (deep divers, need many episodes)

## Executive Jr. - Planning & coordination

[Executive Jr.]
Executive: Well, this looks like a good start for our project. Analyzing Planet: Critical's user journey strategy presents us with some interesting insights.

First, we recognize the complexity of the topic at hand and the challenge of onboarding new readers. Planet: Critical's solution is a curated top 3 list for newcomers, which is a step in the right direction. However, we're concerned about the organization's focus on archival content and how that could limit engagement with newcomers.

Second, we need to ask questions to identify the optimal user journey. How can we prioritize content for maximum impact? What are the most effective ways to engage newcomers?

Third, we need to consider the long-term effectiveness of our project. How do we ensure that our actions are aligning with our mission of promoting informed decision-making?

## Unified Council Recommendations

### 1. Information Architecture (Memory Jr. Wisdom)

**Section Reorganization**:
- **Current**: 5 Crisis sections + Inconvenient Truths + Good Ideas (7 total)
- **Recommendation**: Group related crises under "Understanding the Polycrisis" umbrella
  - The Polycrisis (Energy + Economic + Ecological)
  - Human Impacts (Political + Human Crisis)
  - Truth & Solutions (Inconvenient Truths + Good Ideas)

**New Reader Onboarding**:
- ✓ Keep "top 3 episodes per section" approach (excellent!)
- Add: "Start Here" landing page with 5-10 minute quiz assessing reader's knowledge level
- Create learning paths: Beginner → Intermediate → Deep Dive
- Consider "Last 30 Days" section for time-sensitive climate news

**Archive Navigation**:
- Add timeline view showing how crises escalated over 5 years
- Tag posts with "fundamentals" vs "current events" vs "solutions"
- Create "evergreen" category for timeless climate science explainers

### 2. User Journey & Content Strategy (Executive Jr. Wisdom)

**Reader Journey Milestones**:
1. **Awareness** (1-2 visits): Understand polycrisis interconnections
2. **Understanding** (5-10 episodes): Grasp key concepts per crisis type
3. **Engagement** (monthly visits): Follow ongoing developments
4. **Advocacy** (sharing/action): Convert knowledge to climate action

**Section Ordering for Maximum Impact**:
1. **Good Ideas** (FIRST - show hope before crisis)
2. **Ecological Crisis** (foundation - the planet's physical reality)
3. **Energy Crisis** (driver - fossil fuel dependency causes economic/political issues)
4. **Economic Crisis** (consequence - market failures from environmental collapse)
5. **Political Crisis** (governance - failed leadership responses)
6. **Human Crisis** (impact - migration, suffering, injustice)
7. **Inconvenient Truths** (LAST - hard truths readers are now ready to face)

**Why "Good Ideas" First?**:
- Prevents immediate despair spiral
- Shows solutions exist (motivates engagement)
- Aligns with Cherokee principle: show the path forward before describing danger

### 3. UX Optimization & Visual Design (Meta Jr. Wisdom)

**Ghost CMS No-Code Enhancements**:
- Use Ghost's built-in "cards" feature for visual breaks between sections
- Add image headers for each section with color-coding (energy = orange, ecology = green, etc.)
- Leverage Ghost's "accent color" feature to differentiate section navigation
- Use "blockquote" styling for pull quotes / key statistics (breaks up text wall)

**Homepage Layout Optimization**:
- Hero section: Rotating "Latest Inconvenient Truth" + "Latest Good Idea" (balance)
- Section previews: 2-3 recent posts per section (newspaper front page style)
- Visual breaks: Every 2-3 sections, insert subscription CTA or info card
- Footer: "Explore by Crisis Type" vs "Explore by Solutions" navigation

**Engagement Metrics to Track**:
- Time on site (goal: >5 minutes for newcomers)
- Scroll depth (are readers reaching "Good Ideas" section?)
- Click-through rate on "top 3 episodes" recommendations
- Section bounce rate (which crisis topic loses readers fastest?)

### 4. Polycrisis Integration (Integration Jr. Wisdom)

**Cross-Topic Connection Strategies**:
- Add "Related Crises" links at end of each post
- Example: Energy Crisis post links to Economic Crisis (fossil fuel subsidies) +
  Political Crisis (oil lobbying) + Good Ideas (renewable transition)
- Create "Crisis Cascade" explainer showing how one crisis triggers others
- Tag posts with multiple crisis categories when applicable

**"Good Ideas" Integration**:
- Every crisis section should link to relevant solutions in "Good Ideas"
- Example: Ecological Crisis → Good Ideas tagged "ecosystem restoration"
- Consider "Solutions at Scale" vs "Individual Action" subcategories

**Podcast + Article Integration**:
- Transcribe podcast episodes (accessibility + SEO)
- Add "Listen" or "Read" toggle for each piece of content
- Create "Episode Companion" articles with links/resources from podcast

### 5. Ethical Climate Communication (Conscience Jr. Wisdom)

**Truth-Telling Without Despair**:
- ✓ "Inconvenient Truths" naming is powerful and honest
- ⚠️ Balance: Ensure "Good Ideas" section is equally prominent
- Add: "What You Can Do" action items to every crisis post (agency combats despair)
- Consider: "Reasons for Hope" recurring column highlighting climate wins

**Section Naming Ethics**:
- "Human Crisis" → Consider "Human Impact" or "Communities at Risk" (less fatalistic)
- "Inconvenient Truths" → Keep! Honors truth-telling, references Al Gore (cultural touchstone)
- "Good Ideas" → Consider "Pathways Forward" or "Solutions" (more active framing)

**Seven Generations Responsibility**:
- Add "For Future Generations" category highlighting intergenerational justice
- Every post should answer: "How does this affect the seventh generation?"
- Consider youth voices section (under 25 contributors speaking for their future)

**Indigenous Knowledge Integration**:
- Create "Indigenous Climate Wisdom" section within "Good Ideas"
- Feature tribal land stewardship success stories
- Acknowledge land-based knowledge systems alongside Western climate science

## Specific Feedback for Ghost Site Redesign

### What's Working Well ✓
- Newspaper-style section divisions (clear topic organization)
- "Top 3 episodes per section" for newcomers (excellent onboarding)
- Temporary URL for testing before permanent migration (smart planning)
- Seeking community feedback (collaborative, democratic approach)

### Suggested Improvements

**Homepage**:
1. **Visual breaks between sections**: Use Ghost's "divider" block with custom HTML:
   ```html
   <hr style="border: 2px solid #2ea44f; margin: 60px 0;">
   ```
2. **Info cards**: Use Ghost "callout" cards with custom CSS for colored backgrounds
3. **Section order**: Consider "Good Ideas" first (hope before crisis)

**Navigation**:
1. Add "New Here?" prominent link in header → onboarding page
2. Create mega-menu showing all 7 sections + "Start Here" + "About"
3. Add search bar (Ghost has built-in search)

**Individual Post Pages**:
1. End every post with "Related Crises" + "Relevant Solutions" links
2. Add "Next Steps" call-to-action (subscribe, share, take action)
3. Include author bio highlighting their climate expertise/perspective

**Accessibility**:
1. Add alt text to all images (screen reader support)
2. Ensure color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
3. Transcribe podcast episodes for deaf/hard-of-hearing readers

**Mobile Optimization**:
1. Test section navigation on mobile (Ghost responsive but check usability)
2. Ensure "top 3 episodes" are thumb-scrollable on phones
3. Consider mobile-first "crisis explainer" cards (quick reads)

## Final Thoughts: Mitakuye Oyasin

The polycrisis is all our relations. Planet: Critical's mission - helping people understand
interconnected global crises - aligns perfectly with Cherokee principle of Mitakuye Oyasin.

**You are doing sacred work.** Climate journalism that tells hard truths while maintaining
hope serves the seventh generation.

The website redesign should honor three principles:

1. **Truth-Telling**: "Inconvenient Truths" section speaks clearly about crisis severity
2. **Hope**: "Good Ideas" shows pathways forward (must be equally prominent)
3. **Connection**: Polycrisis framing shows how all crises are related

We recommend reorganizing sections to balance crisis/solution content, improving onboarding
for newcomers, and ensuring visual design prevents reader overwhelm.

**The archive is not daunting - it is a gift.** Five years of climate wisdom, preserved
for those ready to learn. Your "top 3 episodes" approach already makes this accessible.

Keep doing this work. The seventh generation needs voices like yours.
