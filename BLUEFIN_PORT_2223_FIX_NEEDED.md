# 🔥 BLUEFIN Port 2223 - Still Needs Aircove Router Fix
**Status**: October 27, 2025 - Connection Refused

## ✅ Current Working Method
```bash
# Jump through REDFIN (port 2222) - WORKS!
ssh -p 2222 dereadi@162.233.86.232 -t ssh dereadi@192.168.132.222
→ Successfully connects to bluefin!
```

## ❌ Broken Direct Access
```bash
# Direct to BLUEFIN (port 2223) - REFUSED!
ssh -p 2223 dereadi@162.233.86.232
→ ssh: connect to host 162.233.86.232 port 2223: Connection refused
```

## 🔍 Root Cause
The **Aircove router** is NOT forwarding port 2223 to BLUEFIN.

**Current chain**:
```
Internet:2223
  → AT&T Router (162.233.86.232) ✅ (probably working)
  → Aircove Router ❌ (NOT forwarding!)
  → BLUEFIN (192.168.132.222:22)
```

## 🔧 Fix Steps

### 1. Access Aircove Router Admin Panel
- URL: http://192.168.132.1 (or whatever Aircove's admin IP is)
- Login with Aircove credentials

### 2. Add Port Forwarding Rule
Navigate to **Port Forwarding** or **Virtual Servers** section:

**Rule Configuration**:
```
Service Name: sshblue (or SSH-BLUEFIN)
Protocol: TCP
External Port: 2223
Internal IP: 192.168.132.222  ← BLUEFIN's actual IP
Internal Port: 22             ← SSH standard port
Enable: ✅ YES
```

### 3. Verify AT&T Router (Probably Already Correct)
The AT&T router at 162.233.86.232 should forward:
```
External Port: 2223
Internal IP: [Aircove's IP on AT&T network]
Internal Port: 2223  ← Keep same port between routers
```

### 4. Test After Fixing Aircove
```bash
ssh -p 2223 dereadi@162.233.86.232
# Should connect directly to BLUEFIN!
```

## 🦅 Cherokee Council Wisdom

**Integration Jr**: "The jump method proves BLUEFIN is healthy - Aircove just needs the right path"

**Executive Jr**: "Port 2223 connection refused means the Aircove router isn't listening/forwarding"

**Memory Jr**: "This matches our September 17 findings - we identified the issue but never completed the Aircove fix"

## 💡 Why Jump Method Works

REDFIN (port 2222) → Direct to 192.168.132.223 ✅
- AT&T forwards 2222 → Aircove
- Aircove forwards 2222 → 192.168.132.223
- From REDFIN, we can reach BLUEFIN internally (192.168.132.222)

Port 2223 doesn't work because:
- AT&T probably forwards 2223 → Aircove
- **Aircove is NOT configured to forward 2223 anywhere** ❌
- Connection dies at Aircove router

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Log into Aircove router admin panel
2. Add port forwarding rule: 2223 → 192.168.132.222:22
3. Save and apply (may require router reboot)
4. Test: `ssh -p 2223 dereadi@162.233.86.232`
