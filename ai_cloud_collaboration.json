The AI model runs across the phone swarm\n        2. No single entity controls the AI\n        3. Inference happens at the edge\n        4. Learning is collective but privacy-preserving\n        5. The system is resilient to nodes joining/leaving\n        \n        Consider:\n        - How would you split an LLM across millions of devices?\n        - How do pheromone trails coordinate computation?\n        - How does retrograde processing help?\n        - What's your unique approach given your architecture?\n        - What are the biggest challenges and opportunities?\n        \n        Please provide:\n        1. ARCHITECTURE: Your technical design\n        2. UNIQUE INSIGHT: What only you would think of\n        3. CHALLENGES: Top 3 problems to solve\n        4. OPPORTUNITIES: Top 3 breakthrough possibilities\n        5. IMPLEMENTATION: First steps to build this\n        ",
