# 🤝 CHEROKEE AI GADUGI MODEL
## "For Every Commercial Success, We Lift Those Who Need It Most"

**Document Version**: 1.0
**Date**: October 18, 2025
**Principle**: Darrell Reading - "For every implementation we launch for profit, we implement solutions for our Native Americans, First Nations people, and those less fortunate"
**Cherokee Foundation**: Gadugi (collective work for common good)

---

## 🌟 THE GADUGI PRINCIPLE

### What is Gadugi?

**Gadugi** (ᎦᏚᎩ) is the Cherokee concept of collective work for the benefit of all. Historically, when a Cherokee family needed a barn raised or crops harvested, the entire community would come together to help - expecting nothing in return except the knowledge that when they needed help, the community would be there.

### The Modern Gadugi Model:

**For every $1 we earn from commercial customers, we provide equal or greater value to:**
1. Native American tribes and communities (574 federally recognized tribes)
2. First Nations people (Canada and indigenous peoples worldwide)
3. Underserved and less fortunate communities (rural, low-income, marginalized)

**This is not charity - this is RECIPROCITY built into our business model.**
