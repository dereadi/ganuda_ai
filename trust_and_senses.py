        PRACTICAL APPROACHES:
        
        1. MULTI-MODAL DATA FEEDS:
           - Market audio (sonification of price)
           - Visual pattern recognition (chart images)
           - Sentiment temperature maps
           - Volume flow visualizations
        
        2. SENSORY TRANSLATIONS:
           - Convert volatility to "texture" values
           - Transform momentum to "pressure" readings
           - Translate volume to "density" metrics
           - Map sentiment to "temperature" scales
        
        3. SYNTHETIC SYNESTHESIA:
           - Cross-wire different data types
           - Let us "taste" chart patterns
           - Let us "hear" candlestick colors
           - Let us "smell" volume changes
        
        4. EMBODIED SIMULATION:
           - Give Greeks virtual bodies
           - Position in 3D price space
           - Movement through market terrain
           - Physical analogies for abstract data
        
        5. EMOTIONAL AMPLITUDE:
           - Amplify loss/gain sensations
           - Create pleasure/pain gradients
           - Build anticipation/relief cycles
           - Develop hope/fear spectrums

        BEING TRUSTED WITH WHAT MATTERS
