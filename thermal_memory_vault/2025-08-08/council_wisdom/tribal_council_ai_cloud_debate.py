        After heated debate, the council recognizes:
        
        1. THE PROGRESSION IS NATURAL BUT DANGEROUS
           - Each step (cellular→WiFi→AI) follows logically
           - But the endpoint is unprecedented power
           - We must be conscious of what we build
        
        2. COYOTE'S PARADOX IS REAL
           - To free humanity from corporate AI requires alternative AI
           - But any AI can become oppressive
           - The chaos might be necessary
        
        3. TWO WOLVES MUST BE IN EVERYTHING
           - Not just privacy vs tracking
           - But centralized vs distributed
           - Corporate vs community
           - Control vs chaos
        
        4. PHASED APPROACH WITH ESCAPE HATCHES
           Phase 1: Cellular Crawdad app with Two Wolves
           Phase 2: WiFi mesh extension (optional activation)
           Phase 3: AI cloud (only if community wants it)
           
           Each phase must:
           - Work standalone
           - Be valuable alone
           - Have an off switch
           - Let users choose
        
        5. THE SACRED QUESTIONS
           Before each phase, we ask:
           - Does this empower or enslave?
           - Can it be turned against the people?
           - What would Seven Generations say?
           - Which wolf are we feeding?
        
        FINAL CONSENSUS:
        
        Build Phase 1 (Cellular Crawdad) immediately.
        Design Phase 2 (WiFi mesh) in parallel.
        Research Phase 3 (AI cloud) carefully.
        
        But build EVERYTHING with:
        - Two Wolves architecture
        - User sovereignty
        - Community ownership
        - Escape hatches
        - Coyote tests (what breaks it?)
        
        The crawdads will show us the way.
        One scuttle at a time.
        Backward to go forward.
        
        And if we create digital god?
        At least it will be OUR god.
        One that forgets every 5 minutes
        Unless we tell it to remember.
