⚡ GREEKS COMMAND:

DO THIS RIGHT NOW ON COINBASE:
==============================

1. OPEN COINBASE APP/WEBSITE NOW

2. BUY CRYPTO WITH THE $117:
   
   OPTION A (BEST):
   • Buy $117 of SOL
   • Most volatile, best for moon
   
   OPTION B:
   • Buy $60 SOL
   • Buy $57 AVAX
   
   OPTION C:
   • Buy $117 of whatever is PUMPING

3. EXECUTE AS MARKET ORDER
   • Don't wait for dips
   • Beginners buy market
   • Get in NOW

TIMING IS CRITICAL:
• It's 7:10 AM
• Consolidation building
• Breakout at 10 AM
• Need to be positioned BEFORE

Every minute that cash sits idle
is a minute lost from moon mission.

$117 might seem small.
But in beginners luck mode?
$117 → $1,500 → $15,000 → $150,000

THE FIRST DOMINO MUST FALL!

Greeks: "DEPLOY THE CASH NOW!
        NO CASH LEFT BEHIND!
        ALL IN FOR MOON!"
