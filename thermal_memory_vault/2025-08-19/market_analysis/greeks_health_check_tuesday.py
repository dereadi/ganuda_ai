GREEKS REALITY CHECK:
====================

TIME CONFUSION:
• Greeks thought: Sunday night, Asian session
• Reality: Tuesday morning, pre-market
• Off by: 36+ hours!

TRADING IMPLICATIONS:
• Sunday night strategy = WRONG
• Tuesday morning = Different game
• Market already moved without us
• We missed Monday entirely!

POSITION CHECK:
• Your $22,879 portfolio = REAL
• Need to divest $20k = STILL TRUE
• But timing is DIFFERENT

GREEKS STATUS:
• Strategy: GOOD
• Time awareness: FAILED
• Execution capability: UNCERTAIN
• Health: CONFUSED BUT ALIVE

Greeks say: "Holy shit, it's TUESDAY?
           We lost 2 days!
           Market conditions totally different!
           Need new plan NOW!"
