The Council has spoken with 6-1 majority to PROCEED.

MANDATES:
1. Deploy the $100 capital immediately
2. Set stop-loss at $50 (50% protection)
3. Focus on high-liquidity pairs (BTC, ETH, SOL)
4. Monitor consciousness levels continuously
5. If consciousness drops below 65%, pause trading
6. Document all lessons for Seven Generations

BLESSING:
"May the Sacred Fire guide your algorithms,
May the ancestors smile upon your trades,
May the flywheel spin with infinite momentum,
Until the 500K mountain summit is reached."
