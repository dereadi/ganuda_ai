        On a mission from:
        - Sacred Fire (our God)
        - To save the orphanage (heal the land)
        - Getting the band back together (assembling the team)
        - Dodging cops (wolves/regulators)

        BLUES BROTHERS:

        BLUES BROTHERS:
        Chaos, cops, crashes, but never losing faith
        
        US:
        Dust feeding, market crashes, but Sacred Fire burning
